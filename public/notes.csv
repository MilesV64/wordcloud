Awareness of my food waste as the quarantine has really exacerbated this problem!
I’m hoping to better understand my food waste impact and the volume of waste I am truly producing.

"
"I realize that my perspective on race has been limited due to my background and upbringing, and I have not taken enough initiative to educate myself in the past to overcome that. I chose to join this app specifically in order to hold myself accountable to do something, no matter how small, every day to educate myself so I may be a better ally, friend, leader, and citizen."
Wow - eye opening and describes white privilege so well .
Not here
"The reading today put it perfectly. I have not considered that my white privilege gives me advantage and simultaneously disadvantages a person of color. We are taught to think racial equality is helping a POC get into positions of dominance, while simultaneously denying that system. 

I owe it to my fellow Americans of color. Their struggles are my struggles. It’s time to do my part. "
I am committing to learning about anti-racism because I want to practice what I preach. I have been talking about how unequal our society is and I want to make sure I am not a part of the problem!
"I’m here because I’ve been looking for ways to keep going with work relevant to the world today. I want to educate myself, because as a minority, I aim to never aid the oppression of others, how do I avoid it? Educate myself on what it is that needs to be avoided."
"For a long time I was taught racism only exists in explicit ways, through outward “meanness” and clear prejudice towards BIPOC. While this is a fraction of what feeds into racism, it fails to address the power component that largely exists due to systems and structures I implicitly partake in. I recognize my apparent “niceness” might make me a “good” person superficially, but it does not make me anti racist and plays no role in dismantling the systems that are designed to oppress BIPOC. 
"
"In reading the article, I too felt my acknowledgment of white privilege spoken out loud for one of the first times. My question now becomes how can I work to change a system? How can I form collaboration beyond my individual power to change how privilege is dealt out without a second thought? 

I think it starts with questioning my privilege, having conversations about white privilege with other white people, and starting a movement of reflection AND action? So this week, I’m devoting some time to working on this app, to reading books relevant to anti-racism, and to changing my daily “feed” of the world to be a better representation of all the POC in this world. "
"Because we give a shit about hoomans
To be decent hoomans and create a more just society

"Over these last few weeks I’ve started to realize the underlying, subconscious racial judgements I make each day. By participating in daily behavior I hope to slowly learn to unlearn these tendencies while helping to educate my family and friends along the way. I also hope to one day use what I learn in my career (hopefully something to do with education policy)
"
"I have many reasons to take on this challenge. I want to be a better person and educator. I need to examine myself before I can move on to working toward change at higher levels. I wish I had a better memory about things that I've experienced that involve race, but I know there are many. "

"Love a task list to keep focus with overwhelming work that needs to be done.
Loved looking for black artists to follow. "
"I want to be a better ally first and foremost. I also want to have the knowledge and skills to educate others or confront those who may say problematic things. I also want to make sure that I’m being genuine in all that I do. So how can I tell others to act, if i myself don’t? It’s the same with education as well. I do not know everything and need to work every day to unlearn the problematic teachings. "
I hope to find the knowledge I need to educate those around me. I want to ensure that I have used all the resources available to me to enlighten not just myself but anyone who will listen. To learn more about history and the steps it takes to create a just world. I knownthat I must use the privilege I have to help thise who dont.

I have a lot to learn
Educating ourselves on being anti-racist has become so easy. It's our responsibility to educate and check ourselves on our privelege and I love that this is somewhere that I can learn how to do that daily!!
I am committing myself to this journey because it is lifelong and I need help unpacking the things I have been taught.
Test note
"My intention is to be a listen, educate myself and learn. I want to be a better advocate for others and coming into spaces to work through this anti-racism work, dismantling the white supremacy in myself will help me do that. "
"My goal is to become a better ally. After reading the invisible knapsack, I am reminded that there is always more work to do and more learning! It is my hope that if I can become a better ally and become more knowledgable I can pass it on"
I am here because I want anti racism to be an active practice in my life. I spend so many hours on other pointless pursuits that aren’t shaping my views and actions in a positive way.
"I am committing to educate myself on anti-racism each and every day because of the changes that NEED to be made (and have needed to be made) in our society. I have personally never understood why people are racist, it just never made sense to me because we are all people and why would you choose to be racist towards another person to begin with..I never understood why this happened in history. And then it all clicked in high school history class...it was for power over others. I was never taught about this aspect until then and I DO NOT agree with this or condone this. I understand that I am not racist and that I do not agree with racism, but I also know that I can continue to be actively anti-racist by consistently and constantly educating myself. It is really important to me to continue to educate myself because I need to do so to be able to be a competent educator. If I am going to be teaching children, I need to be able to educate them on this as well. I also need to ensure that I continue to not have any biases that could inhibit a student from reaching their maximum potential and provide a safe and loving environment in my classroom. I also need to be educated to create curriculum that is meaningful and accurate depictions of history rather than the version  I was taught for so many years. "
"I am committed to educating myself about anti racism becuase I want to be an anti racist educator and use my privilege to help dismantle white oppression. Students deserve to have a teacher that is educated on these topics, fights for them, and wants true equality in and out of the classroom."
"I am an “other,” and I have lived as a minority for a short period of time. I’ve seen firsthand how differently BIPOC are treated. My efforts to be anti racist have ebbed and flowed. I want to recommit, which means taking a deeper look at myself. "
"I am here to raise my consciousness and continue to work through the never-ending layers upon layers of oppression and racism that this country was built upon and continues to uphold. It’s painful. It’s ugly. It makes me sick. I feel shame for not starting this journey sooner, but I’m on it now. My eyes are open and I’m ready to do my part. It’s going to take my lifetime, and the lifetime of many after me, to dismantle this tightly weaved web. But it’s looooong overdue and I WILL be part of the solution. Forever. ❤️"
"This is important work, and my black neighbors depend on it. If black ppl aren’t free we all aren’t free. "
"I am here because I want to hold myself accountable for incorporating anti-racist education in my every day life. I’m committed to doing this because no one in this world deserves to face oppression simply based on the color of their skin and to make sure I’m the best educator I can be for my future students. 
I want to do this because sharing on social media and signing petitions just does not feel like enough. I’ve been too comfortable with my white privilege for too long it’s time to do more for the Black community. 
I struggle with making the time to do this work because I get so invested and lost in it and I think this will be a really good way for me to have it scheduled in my day and then attainable list of things to do."
"I’m committing now more than ever because as a society we are too technologically, structurally, and industrially advanced for there to be any excuse that racism still exists. More importantly that there are still people out there content with this being the way of things. I know I have a lot of work to do. As an IES major, as a friend of people in the Black community, and as someone who is passionate about social justice and just basic humanity I can’t sit still knowing I could make an impact even a small one. It’s up to me to educate and challenge myself. This means having difficult conversations and coming to understand who the people I want to surround myself with are. "
"I appreciated the read and how it pointed out the privilege that I have on a daily basis that I hadn’t thought of.

 I know I am privileged and benefit from the privilege constantly, but some of them were eye-opening. Diversifying my feed is important, and I wish I had done more for that sooner rather than later. 

Educating myself is important. There are things I’m learning that I was never taught in school, gathering resources and new books to open my eyes to the discrimination in things that I wasn’t aware of. "
"""Although systemic change takes 
many decades, there are pressing 
questions for me and I imagine 
for some others like me if we 
raise our daily consciousness on 
the perquisites of being light-
skinned. What will we do with 
such knowledge? As we know 
from watching men, it is an open 
question whether we will choose 
to use unearned advantage to 
weaken hidden systems of 
advantage, and whether we will
use any of our arbitrarily awarded 
power to try to reconstruct power
systems on a broader base."""
"I just want to come from a place of education. Realizing the little I know makes me so determined to keep learning so I can be a better ally, be more informed, aware and know that I can be a part of the movement forward because I can better articulate based on facts. "
"I read the article that was introduced for a class I was taking in June. I was taking a class titled Racial Inequalities as a social science general education requirement at my school, and the main reason was because of the state that America was in after the death of George Floyd. As a white person, honestly, I was very uncomfortable by everything that was going on in America- mostly because of the rising cancel culture that was going on. I always was aware of my white privilege but I never knew what steps I could take to use my priviledge to help people. I was aware that I may have not been a racist person, but Iearned that that wasn’t enough. I’m slowly growing to become anti-racist.
"
"As a white person it is important to actively and constantly be confronting how I benefit from white supremacy. Learning and listening about the struggle Black people have and are currently experiencing is critical to being a good ally. I want to learn from and uplift Black voices. I am committing to learning where my own actions can change to better support the Black community

"
"I think that, like all things in parenting, these issues must be addressed one situation at a time. Consistent guidance towards raising more aware children will mean that I need to keep educating myself and keep these issues at the forefront of my mind. Children learn by modeling more than anything else so I need to be self reflective about my own views about and interactions with people of color. "

Powerful examples
"I just don’t see how anyone could deny that systemic racism is alive and well in the U.S., especially when you watch all of those little videos in row. People need to wake up and face the world we have created. 😣"
Just utter bs
"I think these videos are great for those who are already leaning this way, but so many of the arguments against systemic racism tend to be toward BIPOC “deserving” these things for a variety of reasons (that don’t factor in the reasons for disenfranchisement that’s are a result of systemic racism). "
"I think the explanation that might resonate the best with a majority of people would be the one that references diseases or loss because everyone has lost someone or knows someone who has battled cancer. Because of this it helps people to better understand that one is not more important than the other, but it’s not the focus during a specific cause. Black lives are the focused, that’s not to negate the importance of all life, but all life is not being threatened. "
"I have thought about this many times. I am fearful of men. As a woman, I definitely have been trained my whole life about how to be safe in public so I’m not a target for attack. And if I am attacked, what to do then. When I see a man approach me on the street, I am on high alert. I can’t help but wonder, am I more fearful of black men? I don’t think that I am, but now that I know the underlying racism that has surrounded me since day one, am I sure? No. I have lived near, gone to school with, and socialized with black people all of my life. So I guess I’m not as fearful as someone who has little contact or experience with people of color, but I tell you, I am questioning everything I’ve ever learned and thought to be true. "
"It’s something that has been instilled in me to fear men generally, but black men more so. It’s a sort of deep rooted fear that I feel has been nurtured through media throughout my entire life. Something I’m trying to squash now."

"1. Being able to keep emotions in check. I know I’m a sensitive person - I often get flustered or upset or angry by things quickly and to be able to realise that I’m feeling those emotions in those moments can help keep unnecessary conflict within, not only myself but with others, in check. 

2. I want to understand myself. I want to know what I like and what I dislike. I feel like the more I know about myself, the more I’ll learn to appreciate myself and grow.

3. I feel like knowing myself will give me a sense of stability. Stability because I’ll know how to keep myself in check and I’m track when the world feels like it’s crumbling down. I’ll be able to realise that it is simply my thoughts and emotions that are overpowering and overwhelming how I feel I’m those moments. I believe being self aware will give me clarity.

4. I feel like it’ll also give me confidence. The more self aware I am, the more ill know about not only the things I need to work on, but the things which make me good. Having that will help me maintint my self esteem and give me confidence within myself. 

5. I want to be more observant. They say is all starts from yourself therefore is I am observant and aware of what’s happening inside of me, I feel like I’ll have a better understanding of the world around me. "

"Currently dealing with my own self limitations that I put for myself because of my fear of how others see me. For example, why am I not more vocal about causes that matter to me? Or why do I not just start learning something without the fear that I won’t be as good as someone else? What I’m doing that’s working as been to start small. For example, I want to start talking more about life, mental health, racism, etc. so I start small by sharing things with people close to me and eventually moved on to just sharing things publicly on my social media. Something I can change is probably my own habit to procrastinate (ex. I want to code better). I want to do something but I wait till the last minute and then I don’t have enough time before I have to submit something for work."

"I'm currently dealing with the uncertainty of what I want for my life and how I want it to look. I feel like I'm doing pretty well and am relatively happy, but I don't know what else I really want which leads me to complacency. Compared to college working life seems relatively in my own control and I'm not worried about fired like I was about failing classes, for the first time I feel pretty competent. Right now I have a job I enjoy and friends I care about, so I feel like I have what I want. But when my friends ask what I want to do next, I just say I'm just content with where I'm at. I think one way I can work on this would be to start thinking about what else I can do. Maybe I look into new hobbies or passions to pursue. One big thing is I still like playing video games with friends but some people ask me if that's how I want to be for the rest of my life and I'm just not sure. I think it's good now to spend time with friends playing games, but maybe it won't be as wise to continue this trend when I'm older and have a family. It's just kind of hard to tell since I'm still relatively young and most of my friends still play video games. Maybe something I can change is how much time I spend playing video games or what types of games I play."
Currently dealing with back posture while working. It is hard to be aware of your back posture without thinking about it. What I’m doing is trying to set reminders/breaks to make sure my back is straight or to stretch my back. I could however try to be more aware of it myself and do more to actively fix thjs
Writing a journal of feelings i may have that day. What caused thag feeling will also need to be asked.

The reason I’m choosing to go on this anti-racism journey is because I believe that overall societal change starts with individual people. And I want to do my part to ensure that there is actual equity for all people.

I can’t give up or give away the feeing of being accepted as the norm, but other privileges I can probably. And I can try to build a society where everyone has the privileges that all should have."
"The list of different tangible examples of white privilege were really powerful and support the point she makes that most white people don’t think race effects them, despite the ignored reality that actually race does effect white people by benefitting us as being “the norm” in America. The most powerful part to me was the conclusion, which asserted that just as male advantage is protected as to not reject the idea of meritocracy in the US, the same is done with the inherent privilege, advantage, and power that comes from having white skin. The solution that the author offers is to raise consciousness every day and to actually act on what we learn from this consciousness. "
"I am on this journey because my eyes were extremely opened to societal issues regarding systematic racism more in the last year than probably ever in my life. The sometimes uncomfortable conversations I’ve had with people have made me stop and reflect on my own privilege and what I can do to help others. I feel like it’s so often easy to turn the other way when you benefit from white privilege, but the thing we need to realize is we will never be able to push forward and make change if we are stuck in our own comfort zones. It’s much more difficult to be the one to stand up and speak out, but it’s our responsibility to do so. I’m committed to making a difference. "
I want to be a better anti-racist and better support equity for all.
Thinking about how to utilize my privilege to elevate equity for others. Is it possible to transfer privilege? In what ways besides financial donations?
"I am here to implement new practices into my everyday life and hold the US systems accountable for the equality and liberty they claim to give to every citizen. I believe we have the power to make not only the greek system an anti racist space but also systems across the country, and it starts with changing ourselves first. "
I am here to learn about systematic racism as a Mexican-American woman. I want to educate myself so that I can help fight against the injustices that many people of color face in America today and to make the United States a safer place for all races to live.
"I have been blessed with a unique position to be an African-American and daughter of South African immigrants. My family’s history was not that of the enslaved people. But walking into a room of new people, no one can look at my skin and possibly know that. I want/need to find a way to make it so that walking into a room I don’t feel the need to justify my skin color and tell them “oh yes I’m Black but actually from Africa”. We are all Black Americans and this country does not treat us in the way all humans deserve to be treated. I will not rest until I and all other Blacks feel self-conscious about their skin color and the snap judgements people will make becouse of it it. 
"
"I think it’s extremely important to educate myself on these issues, I have the privilege of not having to worry about them every day so I have the ability to simply unsubscribe from hearing about them. It’s a necessity for me, a white person, to seek out and educate myself. "
Every little part of life is different for black people. I just think about the intentional discrimination but they don’t even have bandaids or makeup that is easy to find that will match their skin tone. That’s so frustratin
I want to put action into my daily life to become a better ally
I am educating myself on anti-racism as the children I teach and my partner deserve better from me.
The Seed article was enlightening as hell. I’m more interested about learning about white privilege. It makes me even more curious and thoughtful about the experience of m black friends.
I am here to move outside of my bubble.  To become aware of the world and how ALL people move through it. To become better and to get it right- not to be right.
My goal is to learn more about antiracism so I can practice it in my daily life and as a healthcare professional. I would like to strengthen my commitment and conviction to using my privilege to dismantle systemic racism and to combat racism when I see it.
Don’t put a curtain around your children’s white privilege - open up the curtain - love these words.
"I know I need to be better. For myself, my students, my family, and my future family. We need to push for more and it starts in the individual, in their home, in their classroom, and in all aspects of life. It’s not political, it’s uncomfortable but it’s imperative. "
Similar to some of what I’ve read in White Fragility (should really finish reading that). Liked the differentiation between racism as an individual being mean to another vs. benefitting from an invisible system of injustice.
"During this time I’ve taken a lot of time to really think more about the ways in which our system has been built and continues to thrive off of our country’s black population. This systemic racism is provided in part by antiquated laws that enable and promote racism in workplaces and other institutions, which are designed to keep white privilege as the socially normal default in terms of power and wealth.  When in reality, our country’s success was built off of free slave labor, or at the expense of other human beings. Many are led to falsely believe that racism doesn’t exist after the Civil Rights era, however there is much work that is still to be done."
"I want to be better I need to be better. I want to shift my focus form making myself feel better to actually do the work because it needs to be done. In the past and even now I let my guilt lead the way. I’m committed to doing the work to unlearn and dismantle my inner racism.

I have joined because I have realized the racial injustice in the United States and am ready to stand up and speak out against it. It’s time to change the nation built on racial oppression.
I am here to continue to educate myself so I can be better prepared to make the change I want to see in my everyday life and beyond.
"To educate myself, so that I can educate others... To gain a better understanding of white privilege"
I want to use the unearned power I have to help start momentum for change. I am here for guidance because it’s hard to know where to start. I’ve been overwhelmed and I need to commit to this each and every day.
To be an active part of the change for better.
"Living in the ghetto of richfield, my best friend & her family were “dangerous”, people of every color have equal opportunities. “Racism existed but doesn’t anymore”"
"My intention is to be an agent of change who disrupts the system... look at my whiteness, white centered ness and privilege.. learn how to lead others to learn, grow and act."
"While going through the list, I reflected and thought: does this apply to me? I must reckon with my whiteness, but I must also acknowledge my native Mexican heritage. I’m half of each, and found myself recognizing my privilege in just about half of the list. 
This will be a difficult but necessary journey. "
"Some quotes that resonated with me:
“I was taught to see racism only in individual acts of meanness, not in invisible systems conferring dominance on my group.”
“I can go into a music shop and count on finding the music of my race represented...”
“I can go home from most meetings of organizations I belong to feeling somewhat tied in, rather than isolated, out-of-place, outnumbered, unheard, held at a distance or feared.”

Re: black female content creators. I work with influencers/creators at Universal and myself/my team have taken specific steps to diversify our feeds where we find our creators. This pst week we hosted a “black creator forum” where we invited our black creators to join us in conversation about race in media and what they can expect an organization like Universal to do to support the movement. It was an incredible and meaningful conversation for all participants. I’ve added this list of creators to my notes and will share it with my team. "
I’m here to learn more about my role as a white woman in America and how to use my privilege to engage in anti-racist practices and spread the message to family and peers. I’m here to be an ally. I’m here as a social worker to ensure that I can support vulnerable populations and work towards social change.
I am here to learn more and discover more ways I can help. I know I have the power to amplify BIPOC voices and hold people accountable for their actions and I am excited to learn more ways I can do this and other ways to help ally for anti-racism.
"I’m here because my white privilege makes it easier for me to disengage from anti-racist work, and I don’t want allow myself to do that anymore. I have an obligation to be a part of dismantling the systems that uphold white supremacy. I’m hopeful that over the next month, I’ll gain more tools to be able to do that work. "
"I have come to recognize that I must be actively working toward becoming anti-racist every day. Otherwise it quickly slips away from my focus and I fall back into my every day life. That’s part of my white privilege. I get to easily forget about the systemic oppression and deeply rooted racism of this country because not only does it not affect me but I profit from it as a white person. Therefore, if I truly want to commit myself to acting in allyship to support and elevate Black individuals, I must be diligently working to be anti-racist everyday. "
"Incredibly important and informative about just how broad white privilege is, along with the different forms that it takes. I have to do this work and write down some lists of privilege that I have not just in all areas of my life, and educate myself further of the systems that gave this to me, and ways I can work to dismantle them "
I truly have not thought about racism as something that isn’t necessarily “mean” behavior. White privilege is something that I take for granted and have been oblivious to. I hope to change that.
I’m here to create a legacy for black women that’s bigger than me

"I'm just starting to engage with the idea that ending inequality is not about educating individuals to be more equal, rather to start with the policies. Kendi talks about this at length, as does the author here.

I also really appreciate the idea that you have to teach people to give up part of their advantage in order to lessen the disadvantage of others. Male privilege as discussed here is as good of a case as white privilege."
Understand the ways in which I strengthen white supremacy and the actions I can take to dismantle it
I was taught all of the traditional stories that are told about American progress. As a teacher it is my job to confront these stories and make sure that different cultures are represented and learned about by mystudents.
"I am here because I need to be. As a white person, it is my responsibility to think critically and educate myself on allyship. It is my responsibility to help dismantle white supremacy in all its forms. "

I am here to organize and create structure around my education and action process so I can make it sustainable.
"I was told lies about how Christopher Columbus discovered America, and how the pilgrims and Native Americans were friends. I have also always been taught that where you end up in life is a result of how hard you work. Lately, which obviously is not soon enough, I have discovered and understood that these are mainly lies. Yes, you can work hard and succeed, but you can also work hard and not succeed due to existing prejudice against you based on your skin color. I want to try to educate my friends and family on the truths in our history. I also think it’s very necessary that our education system is reformed to teach what actually happened, not the version that makes white people look and feel good."

I think I was told way too many lies when I was younger about what the world is and it’s been a lot of active unlearning since then.
"One of the largest lies is/was based off of hard work and ethic- the person most qualified or most competent for a job is most deserving of it. While the premise is true, this statement ignores the barriers and biases that prevent this from actually being true. When you take this statement for fact and don’t question the ways in which it does not actually ever come to fruition, you lose sight of the biases that it further creates. For example, assuming the hardest working person gets the job without addressing how hiring practices favor equally qualified white men over black men at an alarming rate, and only seeing  a specific type of person in a role feeds the narrative that certain racial groups are lazier, less qualified, less competent, etc. feed the narrative that"
"The author added information in how to use the paper in group/class learning, for individual personal reflection, and encouraged looking for opportunities to use unearned power to make systematic changes.

I am here to learn and think about the uncomfortable reality of my white privilege. I hope to reflect on how to use this privilege to uplift the drowned out voices of BIPOC in our society. This is an opportunity to fill in the gaps of American history and current politics that were never taught to me as a student and discovery those truths for myself.
"im here to continue practicing what it means to be anti-racist. i’m committed to this work because it will not only affect change in myself, but also the world around me + the community that i serve."
I’m here to learn and to be better at understanding and being a kind person. I’m dedicated to learning to be anti-racist for all the people who’s lives and lived experiences are tarnished and destroyed by racism.

A major downfall in my learning/unlearning and education surrounding oppression and social justice issues is my inconsistency. I have woken up and accepted that I can never live that way again. From this moment on I will be actively educating every chance I get and this is just one more resource to allow that to happen
"Day 1

The reading was very powerful for me. Some things that stood out especially were that the author said they were taught about racism in the context of Black people being oppressed but not in the context of white people being advantaged by this oppression which I think is very true when looking at the way we discuss racism and slavery in school. Another really important point made was that we can’t just disapprove of the systems that have been created to discriminate against others, we have to dismantle them and actively change them. This is especially important to me because I think most people (if properly educated) should disapprove of these systems but there’s a huge difference in how you feel about something and what you actually do about it. 

My intentions this week are to become more active in doing and expand my ability to actively help and make change. 
"
I am here because I know racism is wrong. I want to be a change in the world and help others understand how every single person is equal no matter their race or ethnicity. I want to further educate myself so I can educate others.
"It’s important to me that I’m educated on this subject so I can pass on knowledge to others. Being Asian, I know our cultures can be EXTREMELY colorist and racist which is a huge problem for me.  "
"I’m here because as a person of color I want to learn about the systems I have potentially internalized and those that threaten me. As an ally with my own privileges, I have hurt people because of my ignorance. I know it is not enough to want to educate myself for a handful of people, but I think that’s where it starts. Knowing these people whom I don’t want to hurt and care very deeply about, inspires me to be a more compassionate person towards the rest of the world. Without them in mind I think I will forever just be thinking of anti racism as a form of academia rather than something that affects real lives .  
"
Because it’s not fair that I was by pure luck born into a body with lighter skin and thus get to benefit from so many things that at the same time oppress and marginalize so many others who don’t look like me.
"I would like to continue growing on these issues that impact people of color, especially African Americans or Blacks. Despite my Hispanic identify I too believe I experience some of these privileges and I would like to be aware of white privilege and learn how to fight against it. I believe that by educating myself and I NOT ONLY do small things but also helps others around me to stop racists actions and help become anti-racist.

"I was told all the classics: tooth fairy, Santa, elves, etc. But not until more recently did I discover the half truths I had been told too. My mom always made a point of recognizing that I was one of only a few white kids who went to my elementary school. She constantly claims how as a woman in stem she was alone in her classes and faced tons of judgement. I get that in this times we were the minorities, but I think she’s failed to reveal to me the bigger picture while growing up. I wish I had known more about privilege growing up and could engage in activism earlier."
"I find it really difficult to remember even considering race while growing up. I was raised in white suburbia with very few minorities. I didn't attend a diverse school, church, sports team, or anything until I got to college. I traveled and although white, saw a glimpse into the inequalities. I don't wish I had a different upbringing, I wish minorities had the same upbringing. They shouldn't have to worry about food, money, healthcare, etc. I guess the lie I have from growing up is that the US is all white with very few minorities while in fact that isn't true. I was told never to go to ""North O"" because of violence. When I would go there, I would always feel scared because of the news and my parents' opinions. I still struggle with the idea of venturing into ""bad"" neighborhoods or areas for fear of violence, but minorities live in this hostile environment. They experience the stress caused by living in fear 24/7. After Covid, I want to be in areas to meet diverse people and learn ways to help level the playing field for other races. I'm educating myself now and writing letters to express my opinions for change in the gov't, but I know I need to expand my social group. I'm not sure where to do this, but I will strive to find things to do within minority communities when the pandemic is under control. "

I’m here to reflect on the ways systemic racism has benefited me and ways I can help dismantle the system.
"I have so much to learn. I have been such a passive ally. I want to feel confident in my argument and I want the strong emotions I feel from this shit to be reflected well in my words, actions and discussions. "
I’m here to try and learn to be a better human. Be a better support. A better ally and advocate. While also recognizing my own anxieties about what I can and can’t do.
I'm doing this to take accountability and be the white person I have wanted to be but always pretended to be as if I could just naturally be an exception without doing the work.
"I really think back to the curriculum especially in middle school years and I think about all the lies by omission they told. Which people of color they conveniently left out or when they didn’t tell us all the details about a person (the myth of Lincoln ending slavery because he thought it was racist). Their idealization of problematic white people and their omission of BIPOC was apparent. Also my middle/high school blatantly sold the “American Dream”, leaving out the “only applicable to white people” clause!  

Then I also have to think about what lies I am complicit in telling as a teacher. I try to combat this, but I see it especially on SS. The mandated and enforced lie telling. I have to make sure that I’m including the truth and warning them about the lies even at the youngest level."
"I am here to be educated and informed. I want to make a daily effort to be a better ally for black people in america.

"This opened my eyes to all the privilege I have been given for being a while female in America. The article really showed me how I get advantages in all areas of my life just because of the color of my skin, and I’m going to do everything I can to use my privilege to make sure others get the same opportunities and not be held back because of their skin color. "
I’m here to be a better human. To build stamina to be able to accept feedback through discomfort. To learn how to do less harm and to be more of an accomplice.
"I’m here not out of guilt but out of obligation to do something for the people in my life that I care about. For everyone really, seen and unseen. BIPOC people don’t have value just because I have a relation to them, they’re humans just like me. I want to learn how to see the unseen parts of the system, see the system as a whole, in order to break it down and make it equitable."
" Not sure if my previous note attempt save:

Author included use ideas for groups, individual reflection, and using unearned power to create systemic change "
I’m hoping to learn how to treat others as equal and stop stereotypes to I might make. Then to educate other about the same thing
Nope not at all. A bit in college but didn’t really sink in.
"To be a better ally for my coworkers and friends. To participate in the work Black communities, especially women, have been doing for decades of moving the needle closer to a just society, knowing we will likely not see it in my lifetime, but knowing it’s important to work on it everyday in the hope future generations can benefit."
"I would like to be a disruptor, a co-conspirator. I want to support change."

I thought it was really interesting how he chose to start talking about his daughter’s realization that Santa wasn’t real to then transitioned this to him learning about his white privilege. This comparison was great in the sense that many are able to relate to that first realization and he used that connection to get his point across.
"I feel like I have been told I’m a “good person” so therefore I’m not racist. But I know this isn’t true, because of my white privilege. I will be a teacher soon, and I want to be sensitive and learn how to be a better ally for my students and friends. "
I definitely take for granted the fact that my whiteness allows me to “belong” anywhere... I am allowed the privilege to feel “normal” anywhere that I go and with anyone that I meet. Definitely part of my privilege that I didn’t really recognize until now.

That referring to black people as ‘black’ was politically I correct and ‘coloured’ was a better word. But not referring or noticing colour at all was better. That racism wasn’t a big thing anymore and very rare in Ireland. I still have much more lies to uncover within myself but I think I’m broadening my mind and beginning to unlearn things slowly. I want to learn more and read more so that I can actively teach my children the true history and reality of the world today so they don’t grow up with the same lies. I also want to try and help to integrate black history and black authors into schools so that it becomes a part of white peoples education so that their generation will hopefully be better equipped to see the world right and correct our mistakes.
I want to become more knowledgeable on the topic of anti-racism so that I can be a better person and serve others in a way that is thoughtful and useful. I want to understand experiences of those who have experienced so much pain from the systems and biases that have underlaid our society or centuries. I want to be better.
My intentions are to learn and be better for others and for myself. This is an important battle that I know I am strong enough to be part of and I know I am not perfect and have so much to learn. I’m here to learn actionable items and implement them into my life and others lives around me.
I want to be able to educate myself better and not be afraid of getting it wrong because I am bound to make mistakes however I should learn how to be okay with people correcting me on my mistakes.
I was told that working hard is all that's needed. I hope to alter the story for the next generation.
"I don’t like when men are blissfully ignorant to the struggles of women, so I will make a conscious effort to continue to educate myself and be aware of the systemic divide that Black people and POC face"
Test note

The list at the end is powerful
"The article was absolutely eye opening. As a white female, the only inequality I face is with the patriarchy, wage gap, body expectations, and just in general what advantages men have over women. I know of many advantages that I have over any POC, especially female. this article brought some to my attention that i never would’ve thought were happening."
Really pumped about having a single space concentrated with reliable and worthwhile materials that will also keep me accountable for daily learning.
"Honestly fed up with the injustices that have led us here. As someone who is victim of the harm they can and do cause, I’m tired of a world where this is viewed as the norm. I want and believe that everyone deserves to be treated as a human. It’s time to wake up from this consistent nightmare and make this an equal place for all. "
"Similar to this ted talk, I think we were all told more lies about race in this country than I can immediately recognize! The past four weeks or so have been incredibly revealing and educational for myself. I really wish there was some easy way (as lame as that is) catalogue every lie we were told about our country’s, and the world for that matter, history so it would be easier to recognize/reconcile. 

If I had to choose one obvious lie I was told that I’ve been thinking about, it’s that being nice is enough. I think I’m still struggling with coming to terms with that with myself and others because being nice to humans is a big part of it individually, but when it comes to a group effort there’s a level of accountability we need to Uphold. This ted talk made me think that a way to combat this line of thinking is being honest with our kids. When they ask questions like “why are there more black people in this area?” Giving an honest answer IS much more beneficial than telling a lie to protect them. If we can change things from the get go maybe that’ll make a difference."
I'm here to unlearn that my privilege is earned. I'm here to check the biases that I've learnt from a culture that largely represents people of my race at the expense of people of other races. I'm here to learn more about my unearned privilege so that I can become a better ally to people of colour.
"I think that today’s justice in July was very interesting by having small bullet points that are easy for people to understand. For example, point 30,46, & 50 were extremely insightful. I think that articles like these are important for people to read but also think about often in their daily life. At the end of the day, it is so important to realize the shoes someone else may walk in even if we won’t every fully comprehend it. "

I need to be better at noticing injustices and prejudices around me in order to model my life after Jesus. Noticing these errors will allow me to represent His love better. Also I want to support my Adpi sisters of every race.
"After watching 13th, Just Mercy, other shows and reading many things from Justice in June I feel like the least I can do as a white man is to educate myself."
"Why am I here? I am here because for my entire life I have prided myself on being kind. Yet, how can I say that I am a kind person if I treat people differently because of their skin color? If I think it’s okay to say the N word if it’s in a song? The simple answer is, I can’t. In order to continue to pride myself in these beliefs I must take action. In the article, the author said we don’t have to say mean things to be racist- people are racist because the privileges they have from birth. I am beginning to understand these privileges and starting to actually work against them. Like the men in the beginning of the article, I have disregarded them my whole life. Now is the time to see them and take accountability for them. 

"
I want to learn about what I don’t know. I feel like ignorance is what has allowed these systems to exist. I want to spread that knowledge to my friends and family.
"I realize that I take a lot in my life for granted as a white woman. The fight against injustice starts at the individual level; confronting one’s own privilege and addressing the root cause. Only once we do this can we take action to be anti-racist in our community. You must understand where you have been complicit to racism in the past and where that complicity comes from. Then, get comfortable being uncomfortable. Don’t let racist jokes slide. Don’t remain silent and voiceless because if you’re privileged you have a voice that’s is heard! Speak up for those who are not heard.

I want to learn and I realize I was not educated in this field in any point of my studying life. I also was not led to learn about non white contribution and history.
"I definitely think diversifying my social media feeds is an important step. I tend to follow a lot of food bloggers that are asian because I’m looking to cook more asian cuisine, but that also limits the opinions and thoughts I see on a regular basis."
"I think the biggest lies that I am struggling with is what I learned about the history of this country and how we are the greatest nation, respected and adored by all. The more I learn about the actual legacy of the good old U.S. of A., the more I realize we all have been DUPED!!! Being white, I never had to think much past what I was spoon fed as far as history went. My parents always led on that things were unfair to people of color, and definitely voted for and supported those who wanted a more level playing field for all. But WE never really TALKED about things like white privilege or the reality for people of color. Boy, we do now! I am actively re-educating myself, and I’m not going to lie, THERE IS SO MUCH TO UNPACK. 😩😭😡

As far as ways to alter the story we currently share, I am talking to many white friends and family members and sharing with them what I am learning. No surprise, most are shocked. I am hopeful in the sense that it seems many of us are ready to sit down and start digging into the truth, and to talk about it! I’m making spreadsheets to share of books to read and documentaries to watch for anyone who shows interest, but I am definitely still in the beginning stages of learning myself. Aaaaand, I have to vote smart. We all do if we are going to change what really needs to change...the policies. We need to get those out of office at every level of government that desperately cling to this lie we’ve been selling from the beginning. Also, continue to contribute money to candidates and movements in other parts of the country so we can start to make real change nationwide. ❤️🤍💙"

"Growing up I was told that white people of the past were only doing good. I was told that Jesus was white and Columbus discovered America. 
I am no longer believing or telling these lies to myself or anyone. 
As A future educator I am going to inform my students of the truth no matter how hard it may be to hear. "
"I was told growing up(less by my parents and more by the media/other adults) that a black man in a hoodie was something that should be feared. Never mind the white man in a hoodie, or the fact that it’s winter and that black man is cold and doing the exact same thing I would be doing. I was lead to believe that a white man meant safety, and anyone with brown or black skin should be avoided, cross the street instead of walk past them, avoid eye contact. Sometimes I feel like I overcompensate by saying hello or hi to every black person I see because I don’t like the narrative that the media and my mind had created when I was younger.

Love. Happy to have a streamlined resource with trusted and thoughtful information.
Privelege is something we all need to consider
Telling the truth is necessary! The History lessons are a part of a system that allows white people to control the narrative.
"I have chosen to ignore injustice in the past by being complicit or silent. I have been too comfortable - leaving change to others. I have 20, 30, 40 years left hopefully. I can help make change. "

"In response to the video, I thought that the father did a really good job connecting lies like the tooth fairy and Santa to ideas of systematic racism. I thought that stylistically it was very engaging and an interesting connection to make between the two videos. I’m glad that he was able to become aware of the privileges he had in American society and was willing to address it to help educate other white Americans. However, I I feel as though he had somewhat of white guilt while he was talking. He talked about how so many things in American society were catered to the white gaze, and I feel as though this ted talk was accidentally another example. Growing up there were many lies told to me that I’m constantly trying to rationalize/ break free from- my step mom told me that once you tell a lie your brain will constantly work on rationalizing it until it becomes true or until you tell the truth. I feel as though a lot of the lies told to me come from my dad who lives in a white washed misogynistic capitalist reality and I constantly need to break away from. I need to constantly remind myself that there is no one way to be attractive, professional, etc. That there is no right or wrong way to do anything, and that we must refrain from living a life of judgement."
Our world needs change and I must reflect on how I have contributed to the place we’re in today. I must acknowledge my privilege and dismantle my biases.
I am here because racism is a human rights problem. It affects all of us individually in different and unequal ways and collectively it holds us down and causes us to hate and kill each other. This is not a world I want to live in. I know there is better and I want to fight for that better world. Nothing else seems more important.
I want to stop this cycle. I want to uncover how I am racist and playing into racism in my community. I want my child to live in a better world.
"I am ready to earn my right to re-post normally on my instagram. that sounds silly but being less performative about my activism needs to be a priority. i'd like to donate ~$50 to a BLM organization this month, probably by venmoing individuals"
"I loved how she compared white privilege to the privilege that men have due to their gender. This is a great way to think intersectional feminism too because although the author was very aware of how women are viewed by systems in society, she wasn’t taught about the fact that white people had privileges as well. Additionally, her point about this definition of privilege goes along with meaning dominance as it over empowers one group in society. "
"The arch of history and how racism is present today was not something I clearly understood growing up. The past few weeks I have been trying to actively listen to Black activists tell their stories and their history to undo some of the white lies taught in society today. I am having discussions with my friends and plan to talk to my work colleagues about what we can take. I want to look at the representation entation at my company and see the disparities in healthcare and take action to change them.
"
"I think that, like all things in parenting, these issues must be addressed one situation at a time. Consistent guidance towards raising more aware children will mean that I need to keep educating myself and keep these issues at the forefront of my mind. Children learn by modeling more than anything else so I need to be self reflective about my own views about and interactions with people of color. "
"Taught the great American mono-myth about slavery, civil rights, and manifest destiny. Still in some ways telling myself a lie about the ""egalitarian fairy"" in the workplace in particular. I can work through hiring, leadership, and mentorship to shift opportunities."
Privilege is so real. It is so true that it extends beyond our own personal actions of prejudice. It is part of society and has so much work to do to change. Comparing it to male privilege really made me think.

"My results said we would need 1.6 earths if everyone lived by me and that’s below average compared to US’s 5 earths. 😔 most of my footprint is food waste, packaging, and deliveries."
Yes! My shopping habits are things that I think contribute most to waste. Our earth can’t for too long 😔
I’m very surprised with how unaware I was about my own ecological footprint.

"16.97 tons, huh? If I could recycle that would help a LOT. why’d they get rid of recycling in my area???"
"Most of the waste I produce is from product purchases required for my jobs. I don't know how to reduce this without reducing the expectations of my clients.
"
My ecological footprint requires 2.4 earths when america requires about 5. I am happy with my results but know there is room for improvement. I would like to get an electric car and recycle more.
I think that the results ar about what I think they would be but aren’t entirely accurate. There are a lot of things that the quiz left ut that would increase carbon footprints. The thing that contributed most was my house. I am trying to become more earth friendly in my habits.
"Getting started on building habits and keeping up with them (bringing a reusable shopping bag, using washable plastic bags, etc.)

Being more intentional about purchases (ask “is there a more sustainable option?”)

Reusing containers and other items whenever possible, making the most out of an item I will eventually throw away (like paper products)"

My mom thought it was so funny and she took a picture of us that way. Then we switched spots and I sat on his lap :-)

"June 26th, 2020. 

While up in Montana with her family, Madi sent me a picture of the beer she was drinking; it was a “That’s What She Said”. Earlier in the afternoon she had sent me a picture of Otie by the lake and was also pressuring me a bit *too* much to do something fun with my time off from SLCMA. I had a feeling she was interested and flirting with me, but wasn’t quite sure. 

I had sent screenshots of the convo up until then to my friends asking if they thought she was flirting with me, but that picture confirmed it for me. That was a picture taken and sent specifically for me; she was into me. 

I felt confident enough to finalize the plan that’d been circling around in my head. I’d playfully invite her to do something fun together during my break and, depending on her response and how the time together went, ultimately tell her I liked her. 

Eventually we’d go on a great hike up in Albion Basin and I’d confess my feelings for her, but that photo is what started the whole process. It was small and innocent, but felt just right. I guess you could say “That’s What She Said”. "
"This photo is from the end of our backpacking trip. After an incredible weekend I was feeling a little insecure that Ben was getting sick of spending time with me. When Otie began limping and walking slow I was panicking that he was going to get frustrated. However, when Otie stopped and cried and my heart broke, Ben did the perfect thing. Without hesitation he picked Otie up, after a few failed attempts and began walking. My panic turned to something that I can’t even describe. I had to keep myself from crying because I couldn’t imagine a better reaction. What he did, without second thought, showed me immediately that he was the type of person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. A partner who cared about me and what I loved and would do whatever it took without second thought. I took this picture and his smile and Otie’s face get me every time I look at it. It was in this moment that I knew there was no turning back because I was falling head over heels, wildly and incredibly out of control. Sometimes I open this picture to feel the warmth in my chest when I need a smile. I can’t really express how I felt, but it was in that moment that I knew. And I think it’s when Otie knew too that Ben was going to be a huge part of our lives moving forward. And we both couldn’t be happier about that fact. "

"I think these videos are short and to the point to emphasize that systemic racism isn’t some distant idea that we cannot touch or understand, but it is something that people actually experience everyday in so many aspects of life. Grounding it into specific facts helps put it into perspective and I think they’re a great starting point for people who still do not see systemic racism as “a thing.” One of the videos was about government surveillance, something that I had not thought about before in terms of systemic racism and did not know any facts about so I am glad I watched it and learned something new. "
It’s really odd to see all that we’ve learned in school be turned on it’s flip side. Well I guess not on it’s flip side but shown for what it really is. These systems we’ve learned protect us hurt BIPOC and they need to be dismantled and put back together in a way that is safe for everyone and benefits everyone the way the system is actually supposed to work.
"I think it's disappointing/disgusting that when slavery ended white people who owned Black people were paid for each ""worker"" they lost. Yet, the enslaved were never compensated for the work they had put in. For the crops they had harvested. For the buildings they erected. Black people were given freedom and nothing else. Starting from places behind. White cis het men created the systems to benefit themselves and to keep themselves in power. It still works this way. Marginalized people are fighting to get a portion of the power that will lead to a semblance of equity. "
"Such short videos, but such wild facts, I mean DANG. Some facts I’ve heard before, but some new to me. I hate that I didn’t know some of what he talked about until now, but now that I know, I’m glad I do and I won’t forget it. Systemic racism plays a part in all aspects of life. I’m ready for another week of learning how to dismantle that systemic racism that covers the white society."
"As a society, we need to look deeper into the connotations associated with terms that are used as disguised racism. Before this video, I hadn't considered how strongly those terms were a form of racism. I haven't previously participated regularly in politics nor have I researched them as strongly as I do, but I will use this information when calling my parents in and how their views are inherently racist even though they can't see it.

"These systemic racism videos were short and sweet. I was really shook by the surveillance videos because my friends and I joke about ""the FBI agent that listens to us"", but for some reason my ads are different from theirs. That video had a study that was very specific to my ethnicity, Guyanese, which isn't usually mentioned. 
It reminded me that I am a minority and that I am probably regularly discriminated against and I'm unaware of it. "

Seeing the numbers makes it seem a lot more real & damaging. Hard to ignore when black women make 400% less than a white woman
"I appreciate the fact that these videos shed light on all aspects of life where there is systemic racism.  Some of my good friends are middle eastern, and it’s so upsetting to see that they are automatically being watched by the government just because of where they are from."
So I teresktn g
"I have never heard of dog whistles, but I definitely knew what those words were code for. Anyone who is paying attention should!! These same racist ideas are just repackaged over and over, different verbiage for the same idea. "
I knew a lot of this was the case but did not know how stark the numbers were - especially around unemployment and infant mortality. The drug arrest numbers in particular are good to keep on mind for conversations with white friends and family since most are for legalization
Shocked by how embedded it is in the larger systems of society.
"The more that I read and watch about systemic racism, the harder it gets to figure out solutions. Why are so many people ignoring something that is so blatant? It is frustrating. "
I watched the immigration and government surveillance ones and hadn’t thought before about which immigrants get singled out.
The white supremacy that is so engrained in me wants to bypass difficult and uncomfortable ideas/topics and let someone deal with them. After watching these videos I’m now asking myself how I can actively take part in dismantling these unjust systems? What actions can I take on a daily basis after knowing these stats? Maybe the daily actions will and should look different everyday. How to balance learning/consuming information with action and spreading awareness?
"The video about death rates of minority children and the lack of prenatal care for BIPOC was upsetting. Why should some babies and their mothers have a greater chance at life just because of the color of the skin they are born with? Racism knows no boundaries in this country and I have recently learned about how racist our medical system is. Access to medical care is a basic human right and should not be based on anyone race, gender, or wealth."
"I really didn’t understand and know much about systemic racism until the past few weeks. It’s frustrating it runs through so many sectors of life that are all interconnected such as wealth, housing, education, and jobs. Implicit biases are all around us and I think it’s so important we each recognize our own and work to eliminate them to change the ways of our personal prejudices and eventually end systemic racism "
"While I had heard of dog whistles, I hadn’t seen exactly when and where they were used. I think that although I did not use them, I’ve definitely heard older relatives use them to defend their political beliefs. You can tell that it makes them believe that their policy position is the right one and there’s no other set of facts that could change their mind. To them, using these types of dog whistles are as good as stating a fact. I have probably used these terms before without realizing their implications. "
Interesting video. Informative but maybe a little too brief. Would love to hear the numbers unpacked a tad bit more.
"It’s not just in policy, it’s the way those around us speak about people, too. We can call it out in everyday life and hope that it will go as far as policy is concerned. "
"I grew up hearing these dog whistles, and still hear some of them today. The fact is, people like to believe they are superior, and changing that mentality is a real uphill battle."
No just ice! No tips!
I really like the one about all houses mattering while one is on fire. i think it’s a really simple way to explain why the phrase is ridiculous. i also think that the law professors explanation was great for people who need the concept explained to them in more detail.
"I like the analogies, they are easily understandable and hard to refute. Like the house on fire, the funeral analogy, all cancers matter, etc. I feel like when you break it down that way, there’s no rational way to disagree. I haven’t had to really convince anyone of this yet, although I did explain it to a couple of people who didn’t understand the meaning of Black Lives Matter. 

For those who are sticking with All Lives Matter, I just can’t help believing that you are ignorant and I guess scared. I think it’s absolutely crazy that this even has to be explained or defended!! It is beyond obvious to anyone who even has the slightest clue about the way our world works what this statement means and why it’s so necessary. And it’s SUPER annoying that we need to think of ways to reframe it to make it “less scary” and feel “less racist” for some people to accept. Ughhhhhh.

This concludes my rant. 😘"
The conversations usually go better than you think. It’s important to have conversations with people who are different than you and believe differently in order to help you see different perspectives.

Challenging.
"Very relaxing g afterwards, took a lot to not fall sleep! Mind kept wandering it I would let those thoughts go and focus back on my breath. "
"It takes a lot of effort to not let a thought creep in, and even when I think I am fully conscious of my conscience being present, am I no longer actually being present by thinking I am present? Am I still being present when these questions pop up in my mind?
"
Very peaceful and relaxing. I felt my muscles loosen up and felt like everything would be okay.
"An other dimension, other way to experience time.
"
"To be always takes a moment to shake off the pull of the thinking mind. To adore the breath and let go of the need to plan, or run through exciting or intense thoughts/scenarios is a peace that is hard to describe until that moment of letting go has already arrived. With practice it seems to become a more accessible state of mind. Still it is not easy and the thinking mind seems to never “learn” or stop, it just ticks on with or without our tapping into it. "
it feels good and refreshing
It was kinda refreshing
I like to think I don’t.... but truth be told a group of black and brown tough looking kids raises more concern that tough looking white kids ....
"My initial reaction depends on the time and place. Sometimes I might perceive Black men as more of a threat, but I’m often afraid of white men also. Just men generally."
"I’d like to think that there is no difference in my reaction, but I know that is probably not true. I believe that I think a lot more about how others will perceive my reaction to a stranger when it is a Black man. I never feel threatened, but I think about stereotypes and then think too much about how I should act. So it’s not necessarily even about the person, I make the situation about me and how I look to others instead of just acting how I normally would. "
This is so unfair.
Wow. Super powerful article. One of the best I’ve read so far. I’ve realized my own unconscious bias when walking past a young black man (like Jesse Jackson Said) and am consciously trying to rewire my thinking.
"I think in the past it depended on the situation, but I’d like to believe that I didn’t change my actions based on whether there was a black or white mean in my presence. I know for damn sure that won’t be the case moving forward. "
"I do not think I have an initial reaction to seeing a Black person in public, at least consciously. But I know I still have at least some unconscious bias because of societal pressures. I have actually been trying to become a lot more aware of how I feel or react when I see people who do not look like me in public and reflect on those thoughts. A lot of times I think, “they are another person going about their day just as I am.” I do not think I perceive black men as a higher threat to me personally than white men. If I am walking alone at night, as a small female I may fear naturally of seeing a man in general, or honestly anyone, regardless of race because of predatory behaviors but I do not link this to race. After reading that story and countless others of black people “fitting the description,” I always think about how uncomfortable and demeaning that must feel for them. I would never want to make anyone feel the way that man did in the story. "
"No way would I want to change status positions with a black person, and anyone who says they would be okay with that is LYING. Whether we want to admit it or not, I believe every single person knows that we have always treated blacks as less than. It’s written in the damn Constitution!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬The more I learn, the more I realize nothing much has changed in the entire history of this country."
"I read this article in a staff meeting and realized that the profiling cops and people in general do are insane! 
I don't think I perceive black men as a higher threat than white men, however I do feel i percieve men as a higher threat than women. I may percieve black men as more likely to catcall me or say something to me than white men because I don't think white men find me very attractive. I actively try not to make eye contact with anyone if I feel uncomfortable, but I may do it more often with black men than white. I will be more conscious of that now."
I think I do have these biases and this article and conversations lately have definitely brought that to light. Even if I have never thought about it a lot It definitely exists and needs to be changed.
"I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t want to be discriminated every waking moment of my life. I wouldn’t want to learn specialized ways of acting around people for the sake of my staying alive or out of jail. I wouldn’t want to be looked down upon and feared. I wouldn’t want to live in this realm of discrimination, a realm of being forever lesser than. "
"I don’t believe I do this any longer, I am more aware of myself now when I am around a black person. More empathetic as to what they are going through and how they may be feeling in a sea of white people. That said I’m sure I’ve done it in the past... as well as with Hispanic men 😒"
I think personally I don’t see Black men as a higher threat than white men - honestly the opposite as a young woman. But I also have been raised to avoid certain neighborhoods that are known as “unsafe” so I’m sure had i been in those areas I likely would have just because of the stigma or box I had already put a certain type of person or a person from a certain place in. I also find myself currently over correcting and trying to smile at every person of a different race now and I feel like that isn’t the right way to change or “make up for” behavior.
The woman who was watching the Mr. Locke to make sure he was going to be okay was such an important part of this story to me. When I have been in uncomfortable situations whether it be waiting at the train station alone or whatever it may be I know how important it is to have a feeling of companionship. The fact that this woman knew what he was feeling and decided to take some of her time to make sure that he was doing alright is exactly how I think most people should be. Her first thought was to emphasize with him instead of judge him from afar and that made all the difference.
I do not see black men as a threat - rather I know how scary it is for them to be around me as a white woman who could call the cops on them for fitting the description.
"I feel like everyone in my family is just selfish. They're so mean and don't think of anyone. Or maybe it could just be me they're ignoring. I don't know. I look forward to the day that I get to move out and live on my own. 
I'm also scared that abhinav just doesn't feel it anymore. He seems so distant. I don't know what's wrong. I don't know what I'm doing wrong."
"Right so the ‘problem’ is that I’m travelling through this gap of my current skill level to the skill level I wish to be at which is to say, I’m not great at drawing now but I want to be. 
Now the things that I working (I hope they’re working) is realising that I need to understand basic fundamentals i.e. perspective, breaking complex forms in to simpler ones, value etc etc in order to truly understand what I’m making and how to make it. The solution: looking at those more experienced and knowledgable than I am and learning from them, practicing a shit ton and reminding myself that it takes time and patience and failure in order to get there. 
Things to change: I get lazy. Not drawing isn’t going to get me better at drawing. As dumb and obvious as that sounds, I like avoiding failing but then if I don’t get those thousands of bad drawings inside of me, how ans I going to get the thousands of good ones out? 
Possible solutions - keeping a schedule to force myself into doing it - to make it habitual and to stop overthinking (AND STOP BEING OVER CRITICAL AND STOP COMPARING MYSELF TO OTHERS). I need to remind myself that I need to do shit to do shit drawings and to be okay with it. Be patient.

Negative thoughts affect me to a great extend
"I’m an ISFP-T! I think some descriptions about it don’t match with me though. Such as saying a weakness of mine is that I’m unpredictable, so that I dislike long-term plans and commitments...which is entirely false in my opinion... Plans? Not sure, but I can be pretty committed to people and ideals. But I think reading through more of the description does give me a better understanding of some parts of my personality, such as being an experimenter. I think I align with the fact that I like to come up with new ideas, but a downside is that I need to focus more on tangible things. Like instead of thinking about “what could be”, I should also focus on what I can do in the present for ideas that can be achieved."
"They were pretty right on! I just need to trust my instincts more, and reading things like this that really resonates makes me feel empowered to do so. 😊"
"I seem to have changed from an ENFP to an INFP, it looks like SIP has taken a toll on my personality and have become more introverted as a result. I can definitely see it too. I feel less inclined to go out and do things since it's restricted and a lot more content just staying home on the weekends playing video games with friends. These results may be a bit off because even while I was more extroverted I still didn't like parties or being in large groups with people I don't know but I have also noticed I have been trying to make new friends at work and online through mutual friends so I might still be extroverted, not sure. Maybe I can look into whether I truly have become an introvert or if it's just this time of life that has tipped me towards that side."
"In some ways the personality test helps you gauge how you see the world compared to others. The multitude of times I have taken the test throughout the years, I have gotten different results. It may have to do with the changing nature of humans or the idea of categorizing people is kind of...not real imo. I have gone from INTJ -> ENTJ -> ENFJ -> ENFP. Three of my “letters” have changed. Maybe my perspective has changed. Who knows."
"1. I'll be able to catch myself before I start any dangerous cycles of behavior.

2. Becoming more self-aware also means becoming aware that my view of myself is biased. Realizing this will help me approach and trust the other people in my life more when they talk to me about myself.

3. It will help me not just account for and hopefully improve on my flaws, but also help me find more things I am good at and things that I love.

4. It can help me help other people if I know my own biases and perspectives better.

5. It will keep me from acting rashly and, if I already have acted rashly, bring me back down to earth faster."

I went from ISFJ to ISFP-T. I feel like some of the things that were mentioned in my results were true and some of the aspects mentioned were actually what I’ve been feeling lately. These results gave me some clues on what I should probably focus on to become more aware of why I’m feeling a certain way. But I know these results aren’t true for everyone and that it’s more of a general guide.

"It would allow me to be more in touch with my emotions, and be able to deal with them better

It would help me in bettering myself in general as I can look back at my actions and ponder whether there was a better way of handling it

I was shocked at how much perfectly good produce gets thrown away. It made me want to change something about all the food that I buy/don’t eat as well as what restaurants throw away. One thing I will do when I move into my apartment next week is plan my meals and buy less groceries (I always overestimate).
I was very surprised that expiration dates were not actually indicative of a food’s status but just a manufacturer’s biased guess when the food would expire.
"-40% of food produced in US never gets eaten
-Americans throw away $165 billion worth of food every year (20lbs per person each month)
-In 2013, 49.1 million people lived in food insecure households
-food in trash doesn’t get air and creates methane
-sell-by dates are a crapshoot and cause lots of good food to get thrown away"
The biggest takeaway for me is just how much food (especially produce) gets thrown away that is perfectly good to eat. It was because of things like this that my family and I joined a CSA - the sheer amount of food waste that occurs before it even reaches consumers boggles my mind

"Everyone can succeed if they try hard enough. I still think this a lot of the time. I catch myself saying that if x racialized person just went along with the system they would also succeed. Because the system benefits me, I don’t see the roadblocks too much and I just accept things as they are. When I hear folks talk about changing a system it feels overwhelming rather than necessary. I was brought up believing there is only one world view from which we can create systems that will work for everyone rather than that there are many ways of viewing the world and how society should work. I know this isn’t the case. There are many ways of knowing or understanding the world. The thing that I get hung up on is bureaucracy. It’s so stifling. It keeps meaningful change from occurring and so it feels like if we stick with one system at least “something” will get done whereas if we listen to every perspective  I thing will change. I know that’s not the case but I have seen poor integration of points of view (eg a lq Parks and Rec). "
The New Jim Crow
Nope! Never got close enough to recent times to see the more sinister racism. Things in the earlier American times were way downplayed too
"Loved the comp with Santa and the tooth fairy. The ‘egalitarian fairy’. I feel like him, so dumb and duped and shameful that I didn’t see through the lie earlier.

"I thought this was very insightful and a new perspective than I’d ever heard before. His point that just as parents of black children have to have “the talk” about what their blackness means in America, I agree that white parents need to have honest conversations with their kids about the meaning of race—this is fundamental in the process of making white privilege something that’s understand and managed by shire people as opposed to something people falsely believe that they have earned.

"One lie that I was told growing up is that race doesn’t/shouldn’t matter- why not just treat everyone equal? My mom recently told me that when she was in high school, she was taught “not to see color” and that it is better to treat everyone equally, not based on their skin color or any other identity. My parents definitely passed some of that learning onto me as I grew up. Now as I grow older, I have learned that while ignoring race might have once seemed like a way to forget about inequality, not seeing color is counterproductive, not helpful, and almost a “fairytale lie” as the speaker mentioned. One thing I thought about to counter that narrative is the fact that we cannot unsee color because white people in the US were the ones who made us see it in the first place by enacting practices and policies that hurt people solely because of their race. People have always seen color. Unseeing it is not a solution, it is just avoiding the problem. To undo these practices that have been put in place, we need to understand that race and color has been made a central point of idenity in America and we need to see the harm that has been done to BIPOC because of it.

It’s also shown me my classism and motivated me to begin unlearning that. "

I feel like I’ve been told a lot that everything will be okay and everything will work out how it’s meant to. I think that’s a very white centric euro centric point of view as there are millions of people throughout the world who can’t just hope that everything will be okay. It’s a privilege to only have problems that aren’t severe enough where I can just be like “ah stop worrying about them everything will be okay” it’s a soothing thing to say but it ignores the fact that a lot of people don’t have the privilege to just “trust the universe” or other things like that.another like I was made to believe what that the people in power are there to protect us and protect the people. That it true for me because I am white but not everyone can say the same things . I think ti slyer the story is my just takes passing it on to the next generation like when I have kids or to little cousins and stuff. Teach them from a young age what privilege is and how they can beat use it to help underrepresented and oppressed peoples.
"I found the Ted Talk very interesting and I think that this father brought up good points. As I think back to my upbringing and my education I would say the biggest lies I believed were that racism wasn’t a huge problem anymore. That we had changed laws and done the right things so therefore it didn’t exist anymore as a large scale problem. This was easy to believe as a child who went to private school through 8th grade which was entirely white, went to a public high school that was again predominately white and lived in a neighborhood which is predominately white. Going to a state university and seeing what is going on in the world has taught me long ago that racism is still an issue and I plan to continue to educate myself to begin to make that change and I hope someday when I have children that I won’t be telling them lies.

Growing up half white half Latina, I’m coming to realize that my parents sheltered me from many of these racial realities.

There were a few lies I was told when I was growing up. First was the big one to not see color. While I don’t know if I was ever told this directly by my parents, it seemed to be what was ingrained into my head. Until the past few weeks, I didn’t understand why “not seeing color” was a bad thing. I thought this was the way to treat everyone equally and with respect that despite their race or ethnicity we are all the same. Yet within the past few weeks I learned this is not the appropriate way to combat racism in America. Being colorblind fails to acknowledge the unique culture of various races and ethnicities. It also fails to realize there is discrimination among these groups and that we need to help. Being colorblind contributes to the problem of racism in America by ignoring the pain and discrimination people of color face everyday. Another lie I was told was broken to me last week. Throughout elementary, middle, and high school I was apart of my school’s gifted program. I was told I was “special” or “gifted” so I was able to get extra resources. While I was one of the few girls compared to boys in the program, everyone mostly looked like me too. My whole life I thought everyone was “tested” for the gifted program but I recently found out that many of my Black and Hispanic friends were never told about testing for the gifted program, restricted from honors and AP classes, and even forced into special help when they didn’t need it. One of my good friends was even in a special help study hall as as a committed to college senior with other BIPOC. Within the past few weeks I have learned so much about my own privileges and how I need to use them to amplify BIPOC voices and provide my support. We can no longer be colorblind and ignore this problem, we need to face it head on. "
"I don’t think I’ve necessarily been silent in the past. I’ve supported the BLM matter movement and attended protests in my hometown before. I’ve also signed petitions, donated, etc. to causes that are related supporting Black communities. What is different for me now, is that I want to do this work daily, not just in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy. As the podcast said, these types of killings have been going on for centuries. The only way that any of this will change is if the people not as impacted, step up to make change. "
"As mentioned in the video I was definitely fed the white lies about this country’s history - glamorizing colonization and breezing past racial injustices framing racism as a thing of the past. 

Within my family, I received the narrative that people are successful if they work hard enough. Meaning those who aren’t successful just haven’t tried hard enough, haven’t put in the work. For a long time I believed that my family and I had what we had because of our hard work. I was blind to the privileges that allowed for wealth accumulation, access to good education and housing, and various other opportunities I had been granted. 

I am more aware of my privilege as a white person and I continue to educate myself so that I am not consuming nor spreading harmful narratives that feed into white lies and ignore the truth of the differential experiences and opportunities for white folks and BIPOC"
"As a person from a major place of privilege, not just as white but as a middle class white person, I have not realised all the underlying empowerment I have gotten from the white narrative that is all around me. As a child I was ecstatic when I saw a strong female character on screen because I felt represented. What I forgot to realise is that people of colour get that feeling of empowerment even less then I did as a young girl. I never stopped to think why growing cup in private school so few of my friends were not white, or recognised covert microagressions that my fellow students or teachers expressed towards them. I may have done so myself and not known. I need to be educated and truly discover the lengths of which my privilege stretch, and remember that when I felt annoyed and upset by a lack of women being represented well, millions more desire someone who resembles their skin colour to be acknowledged and praised. I can feel empowered and work hard but I have to remember that meritocracy is a myth, and that I have dozens of advantages in my life because I am white. And that needs to change. I realise that I was too passive,  because I didn’t see racism unless it was covert, but now I understand that I must be active not only to fight against that, but to fight against systemic discrimination, and finds ways in which that invisible, yet prominent privilege can be dismantled so that everyone in life CAN have the same chances, and can live their lives equally.

I'm trying to fight this particular lie with truth, showing the back story of the hard work. "
"I do not know why I have been so silent in the past, maybe it’s because I had never considered or heard about the tragedies that occur daily against blacks, or maybe it’s because it never affected me personally so I didn’t pay much attention to what was happening. Now, everything is so obvious and I can’t imagine not standing up for justice."
For me personally I don’t necessarily think there’s a real difference I see the world differently though and that’s the difference. I definitely think I’m at an age that set a different type of awakening but I also think I have a newfound respect for my identity as a person of color that I didn’t have before.

I think the biggest lie I grew up believing was that once slavery was abolished and Jim Crow laws ended racism in America was solved. I believed this until recently and a big part of that change was reading and listening. One particular resource was the movie 13th which helped me recognize that the prison system and mass incarceration in America is rooted in racism. It is a new way to restrict those same freedoms that BIPOC have been fighting for for generations. I will continue to seek out more resources about and by BIPOC to educate myself and then try to share those resources and what I learn with my family and friends to begin erasing the lies we were all raised on
"growing up i was told lies in a variety of ways. one way i can think of, the obvious, is the whitewashed history that we’re taught. i’m spending a lot of my adulthood now learning things i was never taught, and unlearning lies that we’re told. another way i was lied to was the truth ab my class privilege and i learned “i’m better than those Black people” that’s something i’m working to unlearn."
"I was told I could do anything I wanted, that I had achieved what I had achieved because of my merits alone.

"I think that the biggest lie I was told was that while there were awful things going on in the world, I didn’t have any direct responsibility to solve anything. This meant that although I was outspoken about topics I was passionate about (like immigration, racism, and climate change) I didn’t think that I needed to do any internal work or look at my own inherent biases. I think it is clear now that we all have certain biases, and we need to look at them and how they impact others. That way, we can create a space that is truly inclusive and properly fight the racist systems present in our country. "

This video really resonated with me. Recognizing privilege is not enough but it is an essential step and becoming more educated and aware of the white narrative that I’ve become accustomed to means really taking a look at my beliefs and values and thinking about why they are what they are and if they come from a “white lie” or are truly representative of history and our currently reality. I also really think it’s important to be honest with our kids about  these things so that they can be the change and start learning the truth at a young age. What we grow up hearing is influential on how we are and how we sct and to learn the truth about history is necessary to avoid repeating it. "

"I think the protests and social push to learn more about injustice is what’s changed. I’ve had almost like a glass shatter moment in which I’m realizing how unjust the whole government is. I have a huge amount of passion to advocate for groups who are treated unjustly and this just adds fuel to that. I hope to make a lifestyle adjustment to constantly educate myself more about these injustices and become more involved in finding ways to combat them.
"
I have learned ways to be vocal. I never realized I was a part of the problem. I want to be a part of the solution.
"i remember asking my mother permission to be friends with a black girl i met in daycare. she said yes of course, but when i look back i think it is insane how we early we become entrained with systemic racism. years later i tried to understand what things i learned that would make me ask a question like that. l still can’t draw it back to one specific thing. i remember growing up and not understanding why others were treated differently because of their skin. i still don’t understand how some people can have so much hate but i now know how to speak up and what is right. 
"
"I definitely was silent in the past, as all those with such privilege need to be explicitly taught and shown their advantages. I think back to a professional development from the SPLC called teaching tolerance about how it is just as important to decolonize and diversify school s and their curriculum. Because if they are not explicitly taught it they become automatically complicit. I think that many times that is what those in power want. I think what’s different is the education and identity work that’s brought me here and what I’ve learned about how far I have to go."
"I was told who the “heroes” were and the “normal people” were through books and movies and tv shows. 

I want my kids to see people of all races in their media. 

"
"I really liked how he drew comparisons between the gifts that Santa leaves and the “gifts” of white privilege. His point about it being the parents responsibility to tell the truth even if it can feel undermining to the magic and security of childhood is important. As someone who grew up in a household where these narratives were never questioned, I had to take it upon myself to unlearn, but others might not have the same initiative, which is why parental guidance is important. 
"
"As a white woman raised in a white, rich home, I was told many of these lies and persuaded by movies, tv shows, and books into believing them. Growing up in a rich, white suburb, I was unaware of the extreme privilege I was given until I reached 13 years old. This is when I realized the privilege I was given, and how others that were merely miles away from me didn’t have just because their families were people of color. By realizing my privilege it has opened my eyes to the racial injustice America has and was built on.  Now, going to what is seen as a diverse high school, I am determined to learn more about and combat my privilege in order to make sure others with darker skin than me are treated equally. Opportunities should be based off of your work ethic and skill, not based on your skin color or ethnicity. "
Everyone is to be treated equally. Never heard or considered systemic racism.
"One lie that I absorbed growing up is that the only white girls who date Black boys are sluts. I suppose this indicates my high school had relatively more Black students  in the first place.  After having finally shed that belief as an adult and after dating some Black folks, I think about things differently."
"I’ve been told that I’m a hard worker, dedicated, persistent, all these positive things surrounding my schoolwork/jobs/etc. but really, in reality, the reason I am where I am is because of my privilege as a white person. The work I do is seen in a more positive light and criticized less because I am white. I want to make this more apparent to myself, to other white people in my life, and make sure that the “bootstrap” lie isn’t being perpetuated. For some people, it literally is impossible to pick themselves up because they don’t even have the privilege of having bootstraps. White people didn’t even think to hand them out by way of decades of racist legislation."
"Thankfully I was told the truth mostly growing up. My parents did sugarcoat things which I will try not to when I have kids of my own. Especially having a culturally mixed family it’s important to raise kids to treat everyone with respect and equality! 
"
Nope not at all. A bit in college but didn’t really sink in.
"Too many lies to list. But now, as an adult, I’m finding it’s my responsibility to teach these things I did not learn not to my kids but to my parents (obviously if I have kids I’ll do that too). It’s frustrating to see how purposefully blinded my dad is, how he literally ignores the truth because it’s uncomfortable and admits it. But I like this dad am struggling to learn the things I don’t know. And soak the new information into my brain so when I’m confronted with these moments, I actually know how to respond."
"This is a great video. I resonate so much with the pain of “discovering magic doesn’t exist,” realizing after decades that I’ve been fed white lies over and over and only had a sliver of awareness to the truth. My family didn’t necessarily feed me white lies, but I absorbed them everywhere I turned. It’s frustrating. I love that he’s opening the curtain for his kids. For me - continuing to learn  while navigating the white lies still being fed to me is how I plan to move forward. My eyes are open."
"Definitely was told a white-washed version of history growing up. It baffles me how much we didn’t hear about the Black, Indigenous, and People of Color who truly built this nation. I think that’s the biggest lies I was told growing up. I was told that white people created & shaped America, but that’s not the truth. I’ve started to know and understand that these were lies over the past few years. Learned a lot about it in college (with the literature I read). Sadly it’s only as of recently that I have really worked to alter these lies and admit that there is only a bit of truth in what I learned growing up."
That referring to black people as ‘black’ was politically I correct and ‘coloured’ was a better word. But not referring or noticing colour at all was better. That racism wasn’t a big thing anymore and very rare in Ireland. I still have much more lies to uncover within myself but I think I’m broadening my mind and beginning to unlearn things slowly. I want to learn more and read more so that I can actively teach my children the true history and reality of the world today so they don’t grow up with the same lies. I also want to try and help to integrate black history and black authors into schools so that it becomes a part of white peoples education so that their generation will hopefully be better equipped to see the world right and correct our mistakes.
"I think one of the lies I was told by others and by entertainment was it’s the most important thing to be surrounded by people and things that make you comfortable - but all that did was serve to make it harder for me to sit in my discomfort and created a homogenous friend group of people who look like me and make me comfortable and push me to support issues we all agree on. But it left me without push back and challenge, it left me without seeing other people’s points of view. It let more form implicit biases. I am working every day to alter the story and sit in my discomfort and break down these implicit biases - figure out why they’re there and what’s really behind them and what I can do to change or let go of my biases"
I want to be able to educate myself better and not be afraid of getting it wrong because I am bound to make mistakes however I should learn how to be okay with people correcting me on my mistakes.
"I'm not sure what's different, I guess I just opened my eyes to it more because more of my friends were posting about it. I saw posts about problematic behaviors that I realized I was doing and wanted to improve myself. "
Never learned about systemic racism until I took my social justice issues class for my major last year! Its crazy to me how public schools arent including this important topic in mainstream curriculum
"Lie that I was told growing up: when you're successful, it's because you worked hard and earned it. 

This is simply not true. I have witnessed in my own life how my privilege has helped me succeed far more than any amount of ""effort"" could. Because of my skin color and socio economic status, doors have been opened for me without me having to do pretty much anything, while a POC of my same age could have to work and save for years before the same opportunity opened itself to them. "

"When I was growing up I was never told that I was more privileged than others. In history class, the only black history we learned about was slavery. We never learned about juneteenth, or black wall street, or the last jim crow law not going away until the 70s. I was taught that we were all equal because we all have the same rights under the constitution. Not that millions of black people get denied their rights of simply walking down the street because they’re black. That they have pretty much a target on their back because they’re black. I never learned this. My middle school was made up of mostly wealthy white classmates, with very few mexican, hispanic, or black classmates. No diversity whatsoever. While a couple minutes away there was another school with not as many white students, because it is a more low income area and just like the video said, they didn’t get the chance to move in to a half a million dollar house because of their job or where they were raised. it’s like dominos. if their parents didn’t have a lot of money in the 00’s, then it’s going to be harder to get a huge house in a white suburb. it’s out for them from the beginning. The differences between our school is that we have tons ofopportunity, tons of extra money in our school, and we don’t get called “ghetto” by the other schools. That’s the difference. We have it made from the start. The privilege we have from the start can change the course of our life. WI don’t need to get a talk about how to act around the police, just simply learn how about others getting that. I never learned about privilege because it never seemed like I had any."
Really pumped about having a single space concentrated with reliable and worthwhile materials that will also keep me accountable for daily learning.
"I was told you have to study hard and work even harder than my counterparts in order to make it in life. Which was true and false at the same time. The idea behind working hard makes perfect sense. The idea that only my work was speaking for me and could allow my mobility was false. I have to remind myself that even though I’m black, I didn’t grow up in a black neighborhood so the judgement cast upon me was very much because I was black but also because I could in times of assimilation lean on my latinidad. I could sometimes choose what I wanted to be to help me get further ahead. "
"I was certainly silent in the past and for me it was partly out of laziness/fear of being judged and partly a fear that it wasn’t my place as a white person (whether that’s because society has pushed that on me or because it’s part of my own internalized racism, I’m not sure). My outspokenness (if you can call it that, I feel like there are definitely more outspoken people than myself!) now is a mix of lots of things. The main thing being that my white peers are speaking out and it gave me the courage and space to feel like I could as well. 
I do wonder whether other white people’s speaking out motives are! When I’ve talked about this recently it’s been along the lines of hitting the iron while it’s hot..:there’s a pandemic, people are at home, the pandemic has fewer racial barriers as to who it’s affecting, and with all of that happening at once it creates a perfect storm of sorts. Being home near Minneapolis really struck differently for me and being able to see the community around the metro area come together was striking for sure, but I’m still skeptical of myself that if my white friends hadn’t spoken up, would I have hesitated the eways I have in the past?"
Hard work can be done anyone and everyone to get to success (left out the part that some have to work harder). Sometimes I do still tell myself this lie! Yikes.
"I was always told that the deliberate segregation of my hometown was by choice- that people of the same color just wanted to live together. That black and brown people chose to live in food deserts or areas with the lowest ranking public schools in the county or the region with the highest crime rate. In reality, any time more Black or Brown families moved into white neighborhoods, the white families left. My mom never believed in systemic racism, she believed that the law saw all men in the same light and that a jury of your peers would determine your innocence. How can a law see all men in the same light when that light is bright on the skin of white men but casts an even darker shadow over Black men? How can a jury be your peers if they have not lived your experiences of growing up poor and left to your own devices? I will later the story by always speaking the truth and correcting those who do not. It is difficult to tell those you love that they are wrong, but it is more cruel to allow the ignorance and hatred to continue."
"I think that this is where I am at my best - I know what the lies out there are and I know how to tell truths. I think education feels like my way to do that. I learned so many lies about good Confederates and a peaceful South, but have also unlearned and relearned so much."

I was taught so many racists things it’s embarrassing. I’m glad I became aware very young that some of them seemed wrong. It’s not what I felt it should be. I thought people were all valuable and if we were all the same then that is boring. I was taught to fear different. I was taught color mean less class.... not to be associated with.

"It seems counterintuitive to learn about racism from a white man, who seems like he’s presenting on the idea of privilege as a surprise or a secret."
"I definitely think diversifying my social media feeds is an important step. I tend to follow a lot of food bloggers that are asian because I’m looking to cook more asian cuisine, but that also limits the opinions and thoughts I see on a regular basis."
"Everything is different now, I have woken up. I think the past 20 years have created a society that has a short attention span and is desensitized to violence. This is is especially the case with white America. It’s something we WATCH, not EXPERIENCE. We see the video, it’s shocking and sad, then we move with our lives. I too am a Gen X-er, I was a senior in high school when Rodney King was brutally beat by the LAPD. Living in Southern California, the emphasis was definitely focused on the rioting and looting. I remember thinking that horrific video, the first of which I remember ever seeing, was going to shock everyone and there would be some major change in the police department. And there was, I guess, at least in Los Angeles. Even I had heard how dirty the Rampart division was, and I was a white girl living in the South Bay! Did enough change? Not by A LONG SHOT. Things are worse today, there is no accountability and even more detachment from seeing people as humans. 

I’m struggling with how I can do the most I can do, long term. A big thing I want to focus on for the rest of my days is heavily researching ALL candidates on the ballot and find out what their stance is on policy and policing. This is especially important on a local level, the place I’ve always had a hard time finding information. And Police Unions. What kind of fucking monster is that?! Our policing system has got to be torn down and reordered, it’s beyond racist and toxic. 

I will continue to donate money to organizations that fight for this change, as well as sign petitions and call officials to apply pressure for change. Research businesses and companies that are on the right side of thinking and spend my money there.  Initiate conversation with my loved ones about social and racial justice and equity. Join groups that are organizing for change. I want to actively be part of the solution.❤️

"I wish I had been more vocal in the past, but I think what’s different now is that I’m older and more cognizant of what is happening and what that means for people I love and people I don’t know. I think of friends and strangers and how they’ve lived their entire lives differently than me because of the color of their skin. I hate to admit it but I just wasn’t aware of my privilege when I was younger. I guess that’s growth? "

Notes in journal
Interesting how he used something we all knew about to introduce his point of how white people aren’t taught about white privilege. A really important thing he brought up is that it really is essential for us to start teaching white children about privilege from a young age so that they are aware of some advantages they have and how they can use that privilege to help others.
Social media has been a huge factor in why I am overall more aware now of the tragedies that are happening in our country. I think previously I was ignorant to the facts of what was happening and the connectedness of the few murders due to police brutality that I was aware of. I also think now I know how to find resources to educate myself and how I can use my voice to uplift those in the Black community. Previously I thought that since this was not directly something affecting me I should not be the person talking about it. But being silent is choosing the side of the oppressor. It is important to have allies that are educated and understand in order to create change.
"I think that, like all things in parenting, these issues must be addressed one situation at a time. Consistent guidance towards raising more aware children will mean that I need to keep educating myself and keep these issues at the forefront of my mind. Children learn by modeling more than anything else so I need to be self reflective about my own views about and interactions with people of color. "

"One time in the past week? How about literally every day for the past week. Texting her first thing in the morning. Seeing her beautiful face on the phone at night. Talking about our fears, aspirations, difficulties, and plans for our future together. Listening to her say “I threw it in the tree” over and over again just to hear the slight giggle in her voice. Maybe it’s because I’m still in those initial stages of being enthralled with her or maybe it’s because she just does fit so perfectly into me and my life. I’d taken to screenshotting the special moments in our text conversations but I quickly realized that I was essentially just recording everything; every conversation with her makes me feel so warm and tingly. Reading her relationship reflections has been extra special for me  not only are they incredibly heartfelt, touching, and beautiful but I just love her writing style too. I had my first taste of it when listening to her “Where I’m From” at the SLCMA retreat. I can’t describe it or explain why but something about her style, not just her words, is so eloquent and perfect. Last night when reading her reflection on me carrying Otie I couldn’t help but be completely overcome with emotion and love. I miss her dearly but also feel that these two weeks will be nothing compared to the long and fulfilling future we have ahead of ourselves. "

It’s moments like those when he chooses to make me happy, to try to make me laugh or even crack a smile on a bad day that mean the world to me. Ben is simultaneously the most serious and the goofiest person I’ve ever met and it makes my heart skip a beat when I think about it. He tries every single day to make sure I’m having fun, laughing, and don’t take life too seriously and I really need that. I’m really grateful for a partner who is so attentive to what I need, willing to put himself out there, and open to making a fool out of himself because it opens me up.

"I have heard of dog whistles before but have only briefly learned about them. I have definitely used some of these terms before, most likely when I say general policies like “cutting taxes” or things like that and not realizing their underlying meaning and how certain phrases were construed to pit people against each other. Language is so important in policy and politics. The way politicians speak and phrase things is key in understanding their true meaning and who they are targeting. I think the “hardworking American” vs “welfare queen” dog whistle is a really divisive one because people group those two separately solely based on race. Avoiding the use of very general terms could help expose people on what their true intentions are and stop people from avoiding race and saying that calling attention to it is a problem. "
I don’t think I’ve ever heard dog whistle used in this context but it makes complete sense. I feel like these might’ve been terms I heard in history class and have definitely heard very often now but I could completely see the pictures they were painting. I think language is so key because connotation makes up so much of what we’re trying to say and knowing how people we’re portraying our thoughts to think makes us use words that are going to evoke stronger emotions when trying to be persuasive. Politics seems so icky to me like slimy and shady and using words that make people think so strongly negatively about other people is just painful to see because some people really will believe anything.
"While I had heard of dog whistles, I hadn’t seen exactly when and where they were used. I think that although I did not use them, I’ve definitely heard older relatives use them to defend their political beliefs. You can tell that it makes them believe that their policy position is the right one and there’s no other set of facts that could change their mind. To them, using these types of dog whistles are as good as stating a fact. I have probably used these terms before without realizing their implications. "
"Such short videos, but such wild facts, I mean DANG. Some facts I’ve heard before, but some new to me.

I’m ready for another week of learning how to dismantle that systemic racism that covers the white society."
"I learned about slavery in social studies classes using the textbooks written to frame the white experience.

I am amazed at all of the history I am learning that was skewed to fit the narrative that portrays white people as good. I keep sharing new tidbits to my husband because I am so amazed we never were presented with this information.

If we changed the year, I believe it would  help reframe our beliefs, but I also know that it would cause a lot of negative reactions from those far right followers that are still defending the use of the Confederate flag and the display of influential white people in statues to ""remember our past"" as if white racist people were the only people to have made an impact on the formation of our country. I think it is a necessary switch and I'm very happy we are working together to create a more inclusive curriculum and projects like 1619 to reframe the thoughts of students."

"I have not heard of the term Sog Whistles before, but I have heard the terms that were mentioned in the video. I think these terms shed a terrible light on people in minority groups. Through social media, I have been trying to unlearn some terms like illegal alien, by remembering that people cannot BE illegal. You can do illegal acts, but you are not an illegal person.

I didn’t know the language “dog whistle politics” but I’m familiar with the idea of using coded language to pander to racist voters. It’s fascinating how well it works and really highlights how much of a race problem this country has despite the ocular believe that it’s a small vocal minority of racists.
I think that the video is so right about how we need to fix racism before fixing other issues
Wow! Never learned this in school.
"Whoa. This blew my mind about truly how little we are taught about history, and the people who we have been set up to basically worship. I have been so focused on white privilege and racial injustice in the here and now, I haven’t even begun to delve into our nation’s history. We must stop the madness of teaching what we teach as far as history goes, this is absolutely insane and doing a serious injustice to EVERYONE. We must mark the beginning of our country in 1619, BECAUSE IT IS THE BEGINNING. Ugh, I’m disgusted. Abe Lincoln...what a sham. 🤬👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
"
"This I think just reflects another layer of discrimination, and another old and established way that the economy was built against people of colour; this unfortunately makes sense as it wasn’t made for people of colour, and instead was to allow white people to continue to hold them down with their money. I think I need to become more aware, and listen out more for dog whistles, and call them out, as although I don’t recall an encounter of hearing one or having a specific negative image of a person of colour because of a phrase, theres a fair chance that unknowingly it’s happened. Because of this, I must make sure I’m actively listening and recognising them, and most importantly act in a way that may stop politicians and policy makers from using this discrete discriminatory language."
"I hear them from older Americans who consume a lot of TV news. Both liberal and conservative. I know they often don't think critically about it, so I point it out as much as possible."
The language we use to frame a problem that we want policy to solve often dictates the policy. “Equal employment opportunity” doesn’t really solve the problem of an unequal playing field.
"I have not heard of dog whistles before this video and don’t think I have used these words before (knowingly) because I know a lot of times they have these underlying messages of racism and also I think this idea was something kind of new to me as well. After watching 13th I learned more about how law and order and the war on drugs were more wars on black individuals and communities. During this time they were targeted more for drug use/possession along with crime but primarily black neighborhoods were targeted especially. This leads to higher arrests, higher sentences (because crack had a higher sentence than cocaine even though they are the same but crack was more what was available in black communities, targeting them more), and also more stereotypes and prejudice against around the black community. These factors helped lead to current racism now “hidden” by dog whistles and are still ingrained in our system. "

Feels slightly political.
Super interesting and look forward to listening to more episodes. Makes you open your eyes as an educator to simple heritage assignments that aren’t so simple for some of our black students. What great dialogue this can spark!
"Slavery was taught as just sort of a thing that happened, to no fault of anyone’s. It just sort of was. Which is obviously bullshit and always has been. But I think the country just sort of accepts it without truly examining the long lasting effects of it on society."
Sometimes I can have the initial conversation but allow myself to be brushed off easily.
"I think my biggest obstacle is how conversations have gone in the past. I’ve tried to talk to people but most of the time it’s ended in arguments or tears. I think that this approach will make the conversations much more productive, and I’ve already used it once and had a pretty successful conversation. "
"I think the main fear, which I’m guessing is most White people’s fear, is saying the wrong thing. Not just in the sense of not wanting to offend the person we are talking to, but what kinds of biases each of us have that most definitely may come out. It’s painful to look at how our own biases shape our view of others, and racist ideas that we have just...not thought much about. Or if we did think about it, we didn’t DO much about it. Owning up is not fun!! But it’s necessary, and I feel it in my core that I want to be actively part of the solution. "
"I have difficulty focusing on the meditation, even for a short time."
"I felt that my mind was running and it jumped to the past and to the future. Like this meditation will give me super powers or something. But eventually, i realized that only my breath is the current present. Nothing else. "
"I constantly have some thoughts while meditating, but it’s good."
"It's nice. Today I wasn't feeling too great, and while I still had my mind wander a whole lot and found myself less than totally relaxed most of the time, the short time not doing anything helped a bit. Made my spine tingle a little bit too, like last time I tried meditation haha"
"Yes, my mind wandered to my to-do lists, and then felt myself getting sleepy later on. I was a little disappointed in myself that that happened. But then at the end when i reread the description of today’s meditation, I felt Ok that my mind wandered.  "
"I noticed myself drifting off and was aware of my heartbeat, but would try to be more aware of my breath or even try to control my breath. "
Uncomfortable at first because my mind keeps wondering.  Hey
"Did this lying down with my dog next to me, in bed. Definitely had some distracted thoughts a few times, thinking maybe putting myself in a position where I can focus better might be helpful (sitting with my candle and my altar and cushion)."
"It's a bit nerve wracking. I used to be able to meditate much better, but there are times that, like now, that I am anxious to my core and need a lot more time to ground myself. Perhaps I'll go for another meditation"
"Thoughts racing and fighting to take my attention. I feel like I am my thoughts. I will keep one thing in mind though, persistence is the key and that Quantum leap is a myth. Thanks."
"I’d like to think I would but the more my eyes are opening to the reality of racism If I’m
Being honest..."
"It would be a valuable experience for me as a white person to trade my status for that of a Black person in America, but I suspect I would want to trade back as soon as possible."
Nope. Jane Elliot is a bad ass.
"I’m not even sure how to answer the question. At first I think of course not! But why? Because just as the audience on this episode hate being judged by a physical attribute, I would hate that too. It would take everything in me not to blow up and say you don’t know shit about me. But black people cant blow up. They can’t take their collar off..."
"I would never ask someone if I could touch their hair, that’s so rude! I guess I thought that was common knowledge of personal space, but after watching Mena’s Ted talk it obviously isn’t. I’m starting to think I gave human kind too much credit in the past. When you compliment a black woman’s hair, can’t it just be complimenting HAIR?! Your hair is so pretty, your hair is so cool, I love your hair... Idk, why don’t people treat people the way they would want to be treated? It just baffles my mind, you guys!!! 🤯"
"My status as a Guyanese American? I'm not sure. I like be Guyanese, however, I would love to have a grouo, to fit in somewhere with ""my people"" . I feel lucky that I found such good friends, but it isn't the same. I like bein mg different, and I think that helped to shape my personality, but I wonder what Kind of person I would be if I was black. I think I would change drastically. If My parents weren't anti-black. I think I would change status. "
"Jane Elliot was really a head of her time! She is the definition of what it means to be anti-racist. Although some in the audience were very perceptive to what was being pointed out to them, it was crazy how some people clearly let the exercise go right over their heads. "
"I remember this time and the show and mention of the AIDS crisis brought me to tears. Important idea about how to explain ""Why are they so angry?"" "
They're pretty accurate. Amazing to see but I'd really want to develop more. I want character development
"Meditation is hard! I found that as I was trying to relax a new part of my body, I’d catch the other parts tensing up again. Reminds me that we’re so conditioned to be tense and stressed all the time. Need to be reminded that we shouldn’t and don’t have to be. I did actually think my body felt physically better after the 10 minutes though. Not sure about my mind, but I can see how repeated meditation could help. Will probably try to do it more! :D"
"I am EXTREMELY new to meditation! I am struggling with sitting up straight and being still, my lower back and shoulders ached! I actually ended up laying down in corpse pose and doing this meditation. It’s going to take some work to sit up, but I’ll keep trying.🙂I feel calm and ready for a good night’s sleep!"
"I'm not big on meditation, but I have tried it a few times. I prefer to use an eye mask to block out light and just let my mind wind down. One way I used to meditate was tightening certain regions of my body then releasing the tension and exhaling, it kind of worked but I'm open to new ways of meditation because my sleep isn't the best."
"I’m not new to meditation but it’s been a while since I’ve meditated. Like usual it is very hard to keep my thoughts clear and focused. I felt like my thoughts kept drifting while trying to focus without meaning to. The video in particular did give me awareness of my body and it showed me how tense almost all parts of my body are. Even after loosening up, I would notice that I would tense up a little while after. "
"What I'm doing that's working is talking about it with other people. I still have yet to do that fully, so that's also something I can change."
I can start thinking more and stop being so temperamental. My recklessness is my own self destruction and I dont see where I'm going.
"The first few minutes of meditation were great. I could feel my body loosening up and and was able to just focus on my breathing. After a few minutes my mind began to drift to other thoughts, probably since I’m not used to meditating. I feel like mediating could help my body loosen up and let my mind relax more if I do it regularly. "

"I'm dealing with working on working on things without necessarily wanting to? A form of self discipline. 

I can research about it for now, and try applying the research then. The solution apparently is to ""make like Spock and ignore them"" them being my feelings"
"I tried meditation before but I haven’t done it in a while. I find that meditation is easier to do in the morning rather than the evening. If done in the morning, I get a fresh mind to start my day. I recently started meditating again but I find it really hard. My mind starts to wander and think about all the things I need to do this upcoming week and it sort of gives me anxiety. I need better work on putting my focus on my breathing and connecting my soul with my body but my mind always gets in the way. "
ENFP! Although I feel like I’m becoming less extroverted as I’ve gotten older. I’m not particularly surprised as I’ve taken this before :)
Not shocked but always a good reminder. Working in my self critical attributes and feeling inferior and doubting myself.
"My major problem areas come from portioning and the leftovers that come from my meals. In terms of preparation, I don’t produce much waste, but I don’t portion well when I am cooking. I think this goes back to planning meals/grocery buying. "
"The majority of my food waste was unavoidable things, like peach pits and avocado pits and skins, or the very ends of vegetables that are inedible (like zucchini). I was surprised by some of the larger things that went bad simply by being overbought and not eaten fast enough - I put an entire cucumber in my compost pile! Need to work on prioritizing a bit more."
My family started composting (and recycling soft plastic) a few months ago and it’s made a huge difference. My only food waste the past two days has been kale stems and a banana peel and both were composted!
"Coffee is a biggie, but that’s just because I don’t have a compost right now. I suppose I could put it out in the prairie behind my folks’ house though. Been able to get through fresh food without wasting any on it getting moldy so far! Something was almost no longer fresh because I made too big of a portion, and that happens more often when I’m not living with my folks. Avocado pits, banana peels, and grape stems biggest culprits. Mostly fruit bits were wasted. "
It’s been a tricky journey for me these past few days because of anxiety - my eating habits are severely affected and I either do not eat at all or eat very little. During this time portion size is a key issue and I often find myself throwing away little bits of meals here and there that I normally wouldn’t. But I have noticed my dinner tends to have the most waste - it may be the fact that I eat the most (number of ingredients) at this time and subsequently am prepping more items that each come with a bit of waste. I’ve begun to save some veggie “scraps” to use in other dishes and to grow!
We waste leftover food and our fridge is now filled to almost the max.
I’m old enough to start to understand the problem
"The thing that’s different now is that we are finally realizing just how systematic these problems are. Before, I could pass stuff off as isolated incidents. Now I know it’s a result of systematic racism. "
No. I didn't learn about Redlining until a few years ago. I saw it explained in detail at the AAM in DC. Systemic racism literally touches everything we do. We have to take steps to break the cycle.
Well done! Great way to explain systemic racism
"I found it shocking, convincing, and heartbreaking the connection drawn between the viral content depicting black individuals’ deaths and the “souvenir” photos and items associated with lynching and killings of black people in the late 1900s. They made the point that these shocking images/videos haven’t been enough to ignite change, after years of this content and no change resulting, they now just cause trauma. This shifted my perspective on the fact that I thought these terrible acts being depicted were going to help push for change, but their argument was convincing that they do more harm than good."
"I saved this podcast episode in my to-listen stack, after I finish S04 of Scene On Radio about how our democracy has never been “for the people.” Today’s donation was to help repair/replace the water system at the nearby Warm Springs reservation. "
"I knew I was always interested in the field of justice and racial equity but I think I never fully spoke up on anything because I did not think I was educated enough to say something. I still have this fear, as I know I am still learning and might not always say the right thing or have the answer to a question. But now there has been a shift in my own mindset as well as the mindset of this generation that silence is violence and using “not educated enough” isn’t an excuse. It is our responsibility to learn and pay attention and then stand up for what is right. This idea of silence = violence is still such a tricky subject for me. No one should be forced to post or do anything they do not want to and I think the idea that some people tell others that they HAVE to post on social media or something like that is divisive. I do think it is really important for people to engage in the topic and at least have conversations about it with people in their bubble. Starting in a comfortable conversation has really encouraged me to be more vocal about my opinions and learn from others. "
I have started signing petitions to bring justice for people of color that have been wronged by the United States. I have also started speaking out against what I believe to be wrong and false information.

I liked the podcast. I couldn’t tell at first that was the ask so I read the short article and didn’t love it as much. So maybe more explicit directions would help.
"The parts of the essay by Jamil Smith hit home and reiterate some 
Big points I've heard during the protests. This isn't new, it's been happening. I also think talking about how it's affecting BIPOC people to constantly watch a black person being murdered on video. I've had friends begin asking their social media friends to please tag a warning, because people are posting to try to bring awareness, but it weighs on the mind and even more so for people who have been going through this their whole lives. "
I am at a space in my life where I am more aware of Everything!  I am not in my own survival mode and can take in the pain of others.

"I’ve realized it’s not as simple as bad vs good, racist vs non-racist. It’s in everything we think, say, and do. Being kind isn’t enough anymore and it never was. It’s time to do more. "
I think I’m just older now. In the last when all this was happening I was a child/tween. I didn’t understand what was going on I didn’t understand the severity of the issue. That seems like a cop out and it might be. I’m more informed nos. I’m older now i understand. I also feel like I have the independence and autonomy to think for myself and act for myself now. That’s what is different.
"I definitely heard about situations where kids were being racist in my community growing up but being in a sheltered community, almost a bubble, made me feel like their was nothing I could personally do. I hoped that they got talked to or were taught it was wrong. As I grew up and my bubble broke and I met more people who were different from me and had experienced these issues firsthand it became apparent that I do in fact have a role to play. With everything that has happened in the past few months, it has pushed me to educate myself so I can stand up for others the next time something happens. I still have much to learn and I probably always will, but we have a responsibility to help those around us. It’s 
a hard situation because social media has tended to turn toward blaming others who are approaching the situation differently rather then  acknowledging that we are learning and growing in different ways. Having these conversations is so important and is the first step towards change. "
"In the age of information it cannot be ignored. To be honest I clearly wasn’t as aware of past incidents because I didn’t follow activists/watch the news. My feeds were whitewashed to say the least and there’s still room for improvement (obviously). Now I know I need to use my privilege, even if I feel my audience isn’t big. "
"Yes, but in EP we were always quick to pride ourselves in diversity and resources for all minorities. We did have some things going for us but there is still work to do. "
While the killing of Black men has been a reality for Black people... it is just now becoming concrete to me and many other white people. It is no longer someone else somewhere else. It is here and now and we are all connected and impacted by this lack of humanity
A beautifully sad and honest podcast. Have been listening to NPR’s entire playlist of America’s Reckoning.
"I think in the past I was very uneducated and blind to the issues going on. Growing up in a primarily white area, I really felt like I “didn’t see” racism and discrimination going on in my area. I also learned the white washed version of history in high school making it seem like white people were heroes. Clearly they were not. In my HS, there would be occasional cases of people being racist but I felt like there was nothing I could do besides hope they got in trouble. The past few weeks I have been educating myself on stories from my high school, talking to people, participating in calls, and reading a lot about the systemic racism in our country. I have learned about the reasons why I “didn’t see” the racism in the past, I was just ignorant to it. I learned about my white privledge and also ways I can use it to help people. Education is truly the key to changing our nation and I think everyone should be learning and changing their past silence and viewpoints right now. "
"I don’t think I’ve necessarily been silent in the past. I’ve supported the BLM matter movement and attended protests in my hometown before. I’ve also signed petitions, donated, etc. to causes that are related supporting Black communities. What is different for me now, is that I want to do this work daily, not just in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy. As the podcast said, these types of killings have been going on for centuries. The only way that any of this will change is if the people not as impacted, step up to make change. "
My understanding that white silence is white violence. As someone who isn’t directly impacted by this phenomenon- in that I don’t have to worry about myself or my loved being killed by police because of the color of their skin - my inaction only serves the oppressors.
"My husband and I are making donations to organizations after asking our friends with young black children to recommend ones they feel will serve their children’s futures best. Money can’t buy happiness but it can fuel organizations at the front lines for lasting change.  
"
"At the end they said that it matters that people who are least affected are involved. I am one of those lucky people, and I agree. I have missed these pieces of news, I haven’t heard of these many murders, and abuses of power. I haven’t heard about them regarding the UK. But they are present, and I should have looked, I should’ve have seen one and searched for more, but although I knew it was an issue, I didn’t see it happening, and I let myself forget. I can never do that again. Even if there aren’t always videos, or stories in sight, I need to remember that in the US and in the UK tis abuse happens. I believe I am only a year younger r then Tamir Rice would have been, and I am so sad that he is now gone. I cantunderstand how anything like that happened, but it did. Even if we dont see it so blindingly obviously in the UK, we need to dismantle the structural racism that is also massively unfair present here, and I as a white ally should fit harder to make that happen."

"Didn't realize how widespread 
police brutality was. Thought progress was being made. "
"I think a big difference now is that I live in Detroit. I see first-hand what is happening to Black communities and I can no longer ignore it. Where I grew up, I was led to believe that everything was okay because nothing bad happened there, where mostly white people lived. When I left and saw the reality of our society, I realized what was wrong. And over the past 50 days, I realized that I have the ability to do something about it. "
It's too much. There has been too many deaths with no action.
How how how am I only reading this now!
"I do not know why I have been so silent in the past, maybe it’s because I had never considered or heard about the tragedies that occur daily against blacks, or maybe it’s because it never affected me personally so I didn’t pay much attention to what was happening. Now, everything is so obvious and I can’t imagine not standing up for justice."
"I think going to BFS means I was exposed to history that people aren’t necessarily exposed to at other places. I don’t really think that was until highschool though, and really varied from class to teacher to subject. I think the thing that stands out to me the most isn’t what we teach but how we teach it. Yes we do learn about the civil rights movement, but we learn it in a way that makes white people feel like the heroes, and if they sat down and drew up a peace treaty with MLK and racism died, because the white people realized they were wrong. That’s such bull. I think there’s this huge narrative painting that "
I had never even heard of redlining! Let’s change the way schools are funded
"I used to stay silent when racial conversations came up because I felt that I did not know enough to speak on the topic. I knew racism was wrong but I hadn’t been exposed to it enough to feel like I was knowledgeable about it. I now understand that silence is violence. You are either racist or anti-racist, there is nothing in between. Not knowing enough is not an excuse and the only way to change that is to take matters into my own hands and find the resources to educate myself. It is nobody else’s responsibility but my own to teach me about racism. I have recently committed to reading, watching, and listening to Black voices and searching for resources on the history of racism in America so that I can feel prepared to be an adequate ally to BIPoC."
i think what’s different for me now is the continued learning i’ve put in since early college. i think each year i’m learning more + this growth has allowed me to step out in ways i never did growing up. i also feel my role as an educator is a different impact and i hold the responsibility of how i’m directly affecting the students i serve.
"I was told I could do anything I wanted, that I had achieved what I had achieved because of my merits alone. I can alter this narrative by realising two things can coexist but that I have been born with an unfair advantage and to be very conscious of that in my day to day life. Other people are more talented, more intelligent and have better potential than me but haven’t been given the same opportunities. "
Personally I feel before I was younger and didn’t want to see how bad live in America was for African Americans and wanted to just stay in a bubble of being an ally but never really doing anything else. Growing and learning about the oppression and discrimination in my sociology class for some reason really made me change my outlook on what I was doing as an ally. And even now I have learned so much more since the death of George Floyd just because I was looking for the information and I’m doing what I can and trying to help more every day.  Educating myself is the reason I this time was different for me and anyone who learns about the oppression of black Americans and doesn’t do the same is lying to themselves to make their lives easier.
"Much of the content from the podcast Jamir Smith write in 2015 could be used today. -America is taking its sweet time

It’s hard to come up with something new to say. Black people keep getting killed by police. 

Eight grade boy asked: Why have white people been killing us since slavery and are still killing us?

Conventional ignorance is that this isn’t the America we live in now. 

Cell phone and dashboard cameras been that brutality against black people is available all the time. They become #s 

Tamir Rice - 12 years old and killed in a park. 

How much does an over saturation of black deaths actually made a difference in terms of black people being killed by police. More black people are still being killed. 

Idea of good cops: demoralized police are no good for anyone. Theses are narratives that perpetuate a culture of needing police. 

Media outlets have grasped the media appeal and they’re spread through social media to alarm and inspire but to what end?

Black lives matter is a low bar, a mild degree of humanization. 

What act or accompanying footage will be enough to actually change?

People being gassed during a pandemic that attacks the pulmonary system and disproportionately black communities.

Should be more grounding in history of how black bodies were used as souvenirs. Now to look at the new videos they don’t do much to actually change policies and systems that perpetuate racism are they took just souvenirs. 

Reflecting how there’s less of a gender lens in the 2015 article. 
How are we don’t discussing the violence against women and in particular transgender women. 

Defer judgement whether or not this will finally be the moment where people understand if this will be the wake up call. 

White power structure waits for black people to quiet down and settle down. Whether or not actually change will happen is up to people who are not actually involved with this and if they do something! 

The pandemic and access to media and being forced to be reflexive about their experiences and privileges. Looking at how white privileged is reflected in how we experience the pandemic. 

Is it enough now. What happens when we start to go back to normal? 

Media and capturing theses images and being saturated with these images it looses its shock value were desensitized to it. Is it helpful to even see these images? Society and culturally we’re not impacted by violence anymore. "
Wow. Definitely going to share this. Truth bombs abounding
"I don’t think that I fully realized how important it was for me to speak up. I thought that everyone could agree that these things were horrible, and I didn’t think that my individual voice would add anything significant to the conversation. This was especially because I didn’t feel like I knew enough to say anything and didn’t want to sound ignorant or be wrong. I now see just how wrong I was and just how important it is to say something. I don’t think that I know everything or that I will necessarily be the tipping point for racial justice, but I do think that staying silent on these issues is the wrong thing to be doing right now. As the podcast suggested, when people stop talking about these things they die down without any significant change happening. But, as long as we keep the conversation going, there is more potential for change. This doesn’t mean to speak from an uneducated standpoint, but instead I have been figuring out how to educate myself and speak up at the same time because my past inaction should not be a reason for me to do nothing now. "
"We weren’t taught this in school, but rather lived it in elementary and middle school. It was jarring to move to a middle class city and see the differences that existed not 15 minutes away. "
"I feel as though this issue should not have to be justified...this is an issue of morality and not politics.  It makes me so upset that these people were murdered and nothing has been done about it
"
"I was silent in the past because I was ignorant. Willfully so. I refuse to turn a blind eye at this point. I will continue to educate myself and vow to never be silent on these issues again. My heart has been broken over and over again listening to these stories, I will never ever dismiss the voices of the oppressed again. "
"I agree with a lot of what he said. I was taught I was important, worth listening to and could see others in the world that I could look up to. 
I think I did a lot of the harder work unravelling this on my own after I left home. The story I share now acknowledges the context I came from, the privilege imbued within it and my ongoing process of shifting it. I also want to do more to educate that original community."
There is no reasonable reason that it has taken me this long to adjust the areas in my life in order to consistently make time for reflection and education surrounding racism. I have never been unaware. I saw the battle as one that was impossible and took that as a reason to not my everything I have into it. That choice just shows my privilege
"
I definitely was aware of the racial injustice in law enforcement and the country as a whole before but I don’t know that I took the time to understand the full gravity of it and just how common it is. Now I’m more exposed to information and resources and am working harder on educating myself. It should’ve mattered a lot to me always but I wasn’t as good of an ally in the past and I was ignorant to a lot of my biases, now that I’ve started learning more im realizing that I should’ve been educating myself and fighting against racial injustice so much sooner. "
"I was silent in the past, because no one ever pushed me to do other wise. I was silent because I never had Faces to fight for. It all seemed vague, beyond me. I was also afraid. What changed is that I met people who told me their experiences with oppression and the system which upheld it became a more visible. The more visible and tangible it became, the more angry I felt. The more regret I felt for not seeing it sooner. "
"No, what I was taught in high school is if you work hard you can achieve anything. Myth of meritocracy. I was not taught that race is a social construct and that systems can be racist and oppressive. "
You can achieve anything.
"I was told all the classics: tooth fairy, Santa, elves, etc. But not until more recently did I discover the half truths I had been told too. My mom always made a point of recognizing that I was one of only a few white kids who went to my elementary school. She constantly claims how as a woman in stem she was alone in her classes and faced tons of judgement. I get that in this times we were the minorities, but I think she’s failed to reveal to me the bigger picture while growing up. I wish I had known more about privilege growing up and could engage in activism earlier."
No.
absolutely not. i love this video — i feel like it fills in the blanks to understand racism that might not be as obvious because it is so engrained
"Oh this definitely wasn’t the history we were taught in school! But, as a teacher at a Title 1 school, it’s a reality that I see daily. This isn’t just history- it’s current day. I see banks invest a ton of money in some areas of town but not in others. And I see the difference in facility infrastructure, access to opportunities, policing, and so many other examples. It’s a history that needs to be taught so that we can all work towards a change and people can’t deny it."
"I think the media and resources like these has given me the opportunity to learn. That is what it took. 
"
"I have matured and opened my
 eyes to the racial injustice in this country. Although social media can do horrible things like turning human life’s into a hashtag, it has also helped me to learn about the oppression and situations that happen in this country I wouldn’t have been able to learn in school due to the white washing of the public school system in America. By aging, I’m able to finally learn, realize, and express my thoughts about different movements in order to bring change. "
"The pandemic has made it more difficult to figure out how to participate in collective action, but it has also made the need for action even more imperative. Until I can be out protesting, I’m donating. Today I donated to NC Black Artists Liberation Project."
"I’ve been told that I’m a hard worker, dedicated, persistent, all these positive things surrounding my schoolwork/jobs/etc. but really, in reality, the reason I am where I am is because of my privilege as a white person. The work I do is seen in a more positive light and criticized less because I am white. I want to make this more apparent to myself, to other white people in my life, and make sure that the “bootstrap” lie isn’t being perpetuated. For some people, it literally is impossible to pick themselves up because they don’t even have the privilege of having bootstraps. White people didn’t even think to hand them out by way of decades of racist legislation."
Nope not at all. A bit in college but didn’t really sink in.
"Yes I was taught this in high school and maybe even college. Lucky to even be taught it and understand when some schools/ teachers/ professors/ states don’t acknowledge it. Wish more people got how simple it was to understand Instead of hearing black people get less loans becuse theyre less likely to pay it back like people who give this argument hear this fact and that’s all there’s no maybe yes that’s true but this is why...

"I’m much more engaged in the going’s on of the world at this point in my life. Back in 2014/2015, I didn’t watch the news, didn’t keep up on the happenings of the world. I think the 2016 election also opened up my eyes to just how prevalent certain attitudes are still in the world. I thought they were more isolated than they were. I think the rise of social media as a news source has really opened up the world to understanding what’s going on."
"I don’t know what’s different now, I’ve asked myself that many times. I’ve asked myself why we didn’t take the time to learn about all of this years ago. I realize now that so many of us ignored the issues because it was easy to point fingers at the people who are outwardly racist. We aren’t the problem, it’s them, right? But through education and awareness we are learning. Learning about  privilege, systemic racism, and that not being racist simply isn’t enough. We have a lot of work to do."
"I hate that I’ve been silent in the past. I guess I’m realizing now that being silent and quietly saying “that’s horrible & sad” to the murders of Black men and women does NOTHING. It doesn’t mean I’m not racist if I’m sad about their deaths. I want to be actively anti-racist because I’m done seeing Black men & women murdered. Innocent or not, their lives matter, and they shouldn’t be brutally murdered. What has changed is that I’m realizing that my silence hasn’t helped anyone and I want to be actively working to make sure Black Lives Matter. That I am working to be anti-racist. That I am working to be an ally and see others’ POVs, their stories, their cultures... that I am not in my own world but seeing others and their equal place in this world."
"Decade of Watching Black People Die Podcast CodeSwitch:
Codeswitch did another episode called ""Why Now White People"" and it connected with this episode in that they said 'change needs to happen from people least involved '. Those that are not affected by this need to care and it seems that now they do. The more recent episode ""Why now White People"" addresses that exact question. Why now? What has changed? 
My boyfriend brought that topic up a couple weeks ago and how it is frustrating that it only matters now that white people care more. It's not enough for BIPOC to care for years, decades, and longer.

This episode also brought up an interesting point in the comparison of unrest and publicity of Breonna Taylors death vs. George Floyds death.  The two main differences is gender & video evidence. 

To think- If I was silent in the past, what is different now?
I was very complacent in the past and I think I still am to a degree. I would rather avoid the confrontation than voice my opinon or how I felt/how someone made me feel. I don't think I was or fully am equipped with the knowledge and/or resources to be not silent. 
It has been easier with social media and the internet to develop my thoughts fully, find resources that I've read or came across to back my points, and voice what I know is right to those who don't think the same way."
I didn’t know that public schools were so heavily reliant on property taxes
"I think for me personally it was too much too fast and the straw finally broke the camels back. I had the time and I had no excuses to not learn about this any more. The more I learned the more I realized this does effect me personally it’s not just them vs us or how can we as white people help them. We’re worse off as a society when BIPOC are unsafe and not in positions of leadership and they don’t have equity. I think for all of America it really was that there aren’t excuses anymore. We work from home every day and sit there and watch the news and sit on social media and nobody can make excuses. You learn it or you’re part of the problem. And I don’t think that’s a good reason for people to have stopped ignoring racism now, but I think it’s important that we did and we’re doing what we can now as opposed to not at all. It’s just hard to realized I had been so ignorant whether intentionally or unintentionally and I’m trying to not feel guilty and use anything that resembles guilt and turn it into a desire to learn more and do more. "
I wasn't taught this. I wish I was...
I think whats different now is that non-Black people are finally beginning to open their eyes and realize the problem. The video of Floyds death clearly depicts an example of fatal police brutality for no reason. People can no longer ignore the suffering and pain
"I feel like what is different now is that i’ve gained maturity and education. Though social media can be evil and dehumanizing to victims becoming a hashtag, Ive learned so much on my phone that I would’ve never learned in my white washed history class. I’ve started to use my acccount to promote blm and many other issues regarding what’s happening right now. quite honestly, i used to never speak out because 1. i was too young and 2. i wasn’t even aware of the hidden inequalities or even the ones you can see very clearly. i am thankful today to have been educated and taught about issues and how i can speak up in them. i hope many of my classmates saying “all lives matter” will someday feel the same "
"Honestly, I don’t know why I never paid enough attention to the deliberate targeting and killing of black people. White privilege, and subconsciously wanting to hope that white supremacists and race murderers weren’t still a thing in my lifetime. The privilege of choosing ignorance. I was silent in the past, because I didn’t know. It’s not an excuse, but I was young and still learning how to be. What’s different now? Maybe it’s that George Floyds brutal murder happened close to home. Maybe it’s because I have the time and so many others do because of this weird time combined with covid. 

  "
We are in the midst of a pandemic which reminds us of how useless and purposeless our lives can be and this was easily the straw that broke the camels back. News about 3 deaths came out the same week and this was the straw that brokers the camels back. This was finally the time where I couldn’t hear or see a life be stolen from a family anymore. My life finally found a purpose and I couldn’t continue living my life normalizing the morder of people who look like me.
"Absolutely not! I didn’t learn about redlining until 2 years ago at my job! We were NEVER taught about how life looks beyond our own school district let alone the complex histories that funnel in to the correct systemic racism we face today. Watching this video made me feel sad that if we could educate our kids from the start (teaching them about historic policies that hurt bipoc such as redlining, or how property taxes affect school funding) it could have such a profound impact, but like the video says, it’s SO inherent in our systems and there’s no one person or entity to blame that it’s difficult to fix! "
"In the past I was young and naive, I thought that everything would've worked itself out. Unfortunately, this isn't how it works. What's different now is I'm more self-aware and I know that I have unearned privilege where people of colour do not. I understand now more than ever that it is my duty to educate myself on these issues and use my voice as an ally to help stand up for my brothers and sisters, and educate those around me."
I think now there are many more opportunities to learn. I feel it is important to take initiative to learn and not sit back. I also feel like this is not new and it’s being publicized lots on social media. Sometimes I wonder how much education people are really doing behind an Instagram story
I think I’m constantly working to unlearn ideas of meritocracy - that things turn out well for people who work hard at them. I know this to not be the case and I still find it a pervasive assumption in my own life that I have to work against.

The amount of community involvement and time /resources that I have available. So many people are watching that this is the right time for this movement to stop standing still.
I need to research this topic more. I also need to better distinguish between systemic racism and classism.
This has been happening for so long
"What’s different now is probably the fact that probably all the other factors of our lives went away and so we had to focus on what was important to us. Because of the virus, we didn’t have our daily distractions from the cruel, horrible things that happen in the world. We’re able to go on in ignorance. Like the saying ignorance is bliss. But the virus made us as face the atrocious acts head on and call them out. There’s no excuses."
"Definitely not!! When I think of where we COULD be today if this and the true history of our country were taught in school, it makes me want to cry. The more I learn, the more I can’t help but think how pathetic and embarrassing our history is. So basically the complete opposite of what we were, and continue, to be taught. It may sound harsh, but that’s where I’m at right now. Disgusted. I really think videos like this are super helpful and break it down in a way that is easy for everyone to understand and impossible to deny. Although they try, oh do they try. "
This was not the history i was taught in school. I didn’t know about redlining until I was an adult. History classes that I remember did an amazing job of whitewashing history and making it seem that white Americans never did any wrong. This video is a great way to explain a few important things in such a short amount of time to have people understand how there is still such disparity between black and white people.
"Don’t want it to quiet down like he said, I want this to be a movement and revolution for change. "
"There is so much history that is not taught in our schools. It’s constantly being written with the white gaze, being catered to white people. I remember in our history books they even had a white pharaoh in the Egypt chapter."
Recognizing that getting it wrong is necessary for progress
The fact that people are running out of insights on police brutality and black violence is very telling about what society has been doing to prevent these attacks. I didn’t realize that the same kind of movement happened in 2015 as well. This makes me wonder what is different now? Why do the protests and Black Live Matter awareness seem to get more traction? Are people genuinely trying to do something for once or is it just a trend?
"We absolutely were not taught this in school. We were taught that MLK swooped in, fixed civil rights, and we all lived happily ever after. I want to look into uncoupling education from property taxes as education is a particular interest and passion. "
Definitely didn't learn this in school and it never occurred to me and my mostly affluent white peers to ask
Empowered to speak and my eyes have been opened to the reality of right now. Not being as afraid to speak out or learn about the uncomfortable

A bit stressed. Work shouldn’t be as stressful as I make it to be. Being mindful of why I am doing things and that it isn’t for the purpose of people-pleasing.
"Today I’m feeling a little nervous about working at the Amherst store, because I’m not 100% sure who I’m working with. The unfamiliarity is also uncomfortable. It’s okay to feel these feelings, and they give insight to how I feel about change (I’m not as comfortable with it as I claim to be). However, I want to channel and focus on positive feelings about this. The novelty of working at that store should hopefully make the day go by quickly. I also am looking forward to listening to a podcast or Folklore during my drive there and back. 

I also am trying to sink into myself and know how I’m feeling about my relationship. I love how he gives me attention, cuddles, and love. I love how he makes me laugh. I do like how he listens to me and offers suggestions for problems I have, but sometimes I feel like he doesn’t totally understand. I don’t love how he acts immature sometimes, and I don’t love his hardness towards the world."

"Ever since I underwent open-heart surgery in 2015, the more extreme parts of my feelings manifest in physical chest pain. Of course, this phenomenon makes it difficult to separate emotional bodily responses from actual, structural pain that needs further management, but my heart hurting is the equivalent of another person’s “gut feeling.” Last night, I experienced an onset of the all-too-familiar chest pain as I navigate some decisions integral to my present and my future. I am trying to navigate the emotions entangled in those decisions and how to take them into account yet not let them shock me into decision-making submission, in a way. The way I feel isn’t necessarily fixable right away, but a friend mentioned spending a minimum of five minutes meditating today. I have also made plans to have a socially-distanced picnic during tonight’s sunset, so I have hope that little things throughout the day will alleviate some of the immediate confusion going on in my body and mind. I have much to think about courtesy of a certain ~friend and Snap Habit intern,~ so I’m going to try to lean into all of that wonderful advice I got last night. In the end, I have more control than I was originally willing to admit, and things will end up working out, regardless of the decisions I make in the short term. "

After eating (either a simple pomadoro or maybe even a puttanesca) I do the dishes while Madi plays with Otie. We grab his leash and head out in search of snow cones. While driving around I tease that snow cones aren’t actually that good and it’s so Utah of her to be in love with something so silly. Once we finally find them we walk around liberty park and I end up admitting that snow cones are actually pretty good. Madi graciously tells me she told me so. We set up a hammock and pray otie doesn’t get into too much trouble while we try to get comfy.

There’s nothing I love more than talking to Ben while sitting in his arms, so that would be what I’d want to do all night until eventually I’d fall asleep (first of course). Quiet, alone time with no other distractions allows us the time and space to communicate, to cuddle and kiss all we want and the opportunity to enjoy each other’s company. All I really care about it getting to spend time with Ben where I’ll get to continue to fall head over heels joyfully and gratefully. "

"I think I was first taught about slavery very generically in middle school but just learned the basic facts about the Civil War and things like that. I read the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass in 9th grade I think and that was probably one of the most in depth lessons I had about slavery in my earlier schooling. I have learned so much more about slavery in the past few years and how so many of the leaders we were taught to look up to also owned slaves and how all of their work about freedom and independence is so contradictory because they enslaved people themselves. I have also learned the generational impact of slavery and how even when slavery was abolished, new ways to keep African Americans enslaved legally were created. I listened to the entire 1619 podcast about a month ago and learned so much history I never knew about. If we started teaching kids about this early history, we’d grow up with a more holistic understanding of how a country that espouses freedom was founded on the backs of people in bondage. "
"I think I was first taught about slavery in middle school, although we had definitely learned about the Revolutionary War in elementary school. It was presented as something that was obviously awful, but over. And although we learned about how slavery led to the Civil Rights movement, it was treated like that was the end to systemic racism. These stories help show just how deep this goes, how everything that has been painted as a victory actually has a complex background that needs to be explored, and how we need to have these resources in schools to properly educate children. If we were to move the beginning of our country to 1619 I think it would help show that although we like to talk a lot about freedom in America, we were a country built on discrimination. "
"The indoctrination of whites bring the principle race in schools, television, radio, books, etc has allowed white people to see themselves as superior. People if color rarely see themselves and their cultures accurately portrayed in media. This is another form of oppression. Typically we have seen people of color in medoa as being the criminal, the helpless, the next, the incapable group who needs to be saved by the heroic white person. The simple fact that a race has been delegated to this sort of role perpetuates the thoughts and beliefs of all people no matter their skin color.

The cycle of incarceration in the US is going to continue until we as a society stop for profit prisons and focus on the rehabilitation of prisoners in all aspects. They need mental health support, skills training, decent food and living conditions, assistance upon release, the ability to find a legit job that is going to provide them the money needed to survive without turning back to a life of crime to support themselves. 

We also have to rethink the priorities of our police departments and what role that they should be playing to end the mass incarceration here in the US. We need to decriminalize minor drug offenses, ensure fair punishment for the same offenses, and work toward a smaller number of prisoners and prisons. "
Straight line. California spends exponentially more on prisons than schools.
"I was taught about slavery I think in elementary school. It's a big part of American history. Of course, I didn't know all the stories and how scary and horrific the slave ships were. I didn't realize how instrumental Black people were to creating the democracy we know today. People would not be happy with 1619 but it was definitely the start of SOMETHING. "
"1619 podcast:
The things I learned in this podcast were not taught to me in school even in highschool and college, that I can remember. The facts about Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that were shared that we don't get taught it essential to our learning about the white saviorism of history. Why don't we start in 1619 or even earlier? 
I will be finishing the series this week!"

Certain behaviours or training to escape slavery we’re pathologized as mental health disorders. Victim blaming

"
"Well, the first thing that strikes me is the fact that policing as we know it is directly tied to slave laws and their enforcement. I mean, it was bound to be corrupt and racist. How could it not? The fact that more people don’t look into the beginnings of our police force before jumping down anyone’s throats who even question their system is beyond ignorant. Is it because they are scared of what ugliness is under that blue rug if they lift it up? Hell yeah it is. It was broken from the start, and if you don’t see that, YOU’RE broken! 
Steps to ending this cycle. Man, so many steps are needed!! Holding police accountable would be a great start, as well as REAL training on how to deal with people on a human level instead of seeing black bodies as a threat that must be stamped out. Transparency and accountability in policing, jails and the probation systems. It’s out of control, people believing they are above the law. Which they kind of are, and always have been. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Ain’t that the truth. 
Another huge step would be building up and investing in our hardest hit communities. When people have hope for a better future and pride in their communities, only good things will come. We must equal this damn playing field and stop being a nation of force. I mean that’s kind of how we’ve always been, but it’s time for that shit to end. Now. Ugh. "
In the south where I was raised we were taught the civil war wasn't about slavery. Lincoln was not presented as an unambiguously good person - but nothing like these quotes in the episode.
I don’t remember ever learning anything about slavery in school until 11th grade when we read The Peculiar Institution and watched Birth of a Nation before a trip to Washington DC in my AP History class.
"When we were taught about slavery in school we started with the slave trade triangle. We learned about the big ships filled with shackled people who were then sold into slavery at rates based on their size and physical ability. We learned about slavery ending with the conclusion of the civil war. I think if we learned a more holistic version of history starting from 1619 we would have a better idea of how our country realistically got started, who was here before, and what white people did to others in order to build America. There is a complex history with many layers and time periods, but many of that is skipped over when we start “American history” in 1776."
"When I was first taught about slavery I learned about the trade triangle and the very basics with slavery and Harriet Tubman. In high school, my APUSH teacher made us call “slaves” “enslaved individuals” to emphasize how they were forced into doing this and stripped of their humanity. Today, I learned that slavery continued far past the emancipation proclamation but in different ways. Now we have people doing labor in prisons, the loop hole of the 13th amendment which mad slavery illegal unless in jail. I also think if we started in 1619 we would need to include more of the stories of slavery and would help to decrease the whitewashed history. "
"I don’t know where to begin if we don’t have lawmakers with this mentality. We can continue to do the work each day and educate those around us but it seems that there are still so many ignorant people that don’t believe this is a real crisis, which is definitely discouraging.

"I think the way to solve this is an overhaul and full reform of the system. I think we need to take a long hard look at the way we hire police, the way we find police, and what we fund them to do. Defunding the police is a great step but I struggle with having the conversation with those who think that this issue is, as Coates says, that Black people are just inherently more criminal than whites people. That they just make worse choices than people of other races. I don’t know how to counteract that argument because it’s so thoughtless and absurd and there doesn’t seem to be anything you can say to make a logical argument with people like that because they don’t care about logic, facts, or even understanding the root problem. They just want to treat the symptoms with more police."
"Although I think I’ve moved to Active, I’ve found that in order to be consistently an Advocate, I have to return to even being Aware of when an Advocacy moment presents itself. I’ll initiate a conversation about this on the White Affinity Slack channel at work."
i think i’m in aware stage and i’m trying to become active. i need to educate myself more and find more opportunities to speak up and take concrete  steps.
"I would say I have entered into the “active” phase of this awakening. I am definitely having conversations with people about racism, policing, voting and the real history of our country. But I must admit, most of these people are either like minded or open to hearing as well as open to change. Thanks to Covid I have been tucked away from the general population, so I haven’t had the chance to have any interaction with people who are “apathetic” or just blatantly racist. It’s definitely coming though, especially in my service industry career. I did have a visit with a friend a few weeks back who said some things to me that I now realize are racist. I am planning on revisiting that conversation soon, in a loving and informative way. 😊"

I feel one of the best ways an individual can help to create safer spaces for Black women is to stand up when they see racist behavior playing out. It’s scary as hell to do. I’m not going to lie, I’m terrified at the thought of it. But it has to be done, it’s the least I and people who look like me can do. We need to hear, support and empower black women, ESPECIALLY if we ARE women! "
"So many people have had their hair touched by people they've never met before at least once a month. 18% of those people said it happened once a week. Wtf! 
""I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change, by changing the things I cannot accept.""

I have never asked to touch a black persons hair that I can recall. I can't say that I have had many black female friends in my life and I wish to change that, but I would never touch a strangers hair! I think that is part of my personality though. I don't like bein touched,  so why would I touch someone else. If I like the way a black persons hair looks, I would compliment it's looks? I'm not sure how I would change the way I compliment? I would say that it looks nice, that I like the curls, or that I like the volume? Is that okay?

"I really related to when she was talking about her experiences when the girl wrote the play about slavery. I grew up in theater and was constantly surrounding by white people who frequently said microaggressions however I never felt like I could speak up because they were my “friends” and would soon become the “angry black girl” so I usually didn’t and when I did, I just felt bad about it.

"The biggest mistake I have done was probably not being selfish enough. As in I tend to be the nurturing type to the point that it translates to overpowering type of person depending on the scenario. I do things for other people just because I want to get it done for them and I don’t want them to bother or go through the hassle. I do things for people and/or take their lives into more consideration than my own. Not sure why other than because I think they can’t do it themselves or because I think they won’t do it as well. Hm. Writing this out makes me think another mistake is just being too overbearing and not relate to my original point about selfishness at all. LOL but I don’t really want to share about why I said I need to be more selfish so uh maybe this will just be about how I’m too overbearing. Yeah let’s go with that. HAHA but I think all my friends can see that I’m overbearing or demanding. Or just straight up bossy. I just want to do things myself. I think about this all the time. It’s half of not wanting to bother the other person and half of me thinking they won’t do a task to how I would have liked it done, even though they’re probably fully capable.

"I'm honestly most surprised that I moved out of the house after high school and started to grow in independence living with close friends. I thought that given my disability and dependence on my family I'd need to live at home for a while so it's suprising that I didn't. I do my own laundry, cook, clean, pay bills, and drive to work on my own. Considering I used to be afraid of going places alone, I'm much more confident than I used to be which is encouraging."
"I couldn’t imagine living without my phone. It’s quite sad to think about it, but my phone is the most used device of the day. In fact I’m using it right now. I use it to do everything basically. Entertainment, communication, research, etc. while it is useful, it is harmful in that it takes a lot a way from other things that I could do. But also I can do it on my phone? It’s really hard to think back to early high school when my phone was a device to let my parents know when to pick me up vs now where it’s an all in one gadget. Back then I could see myself drawing more and reading more, as well as staring off into space more. While I could theoretically put my phone away for a whole day and do the same, the fact that my life is so centered on my phone is wild. Even if I don’t use it for a day I’ll get it back eventually. And it’s not like I can really not use it. It’s too integral in my life. I use it to talk to people and keep up with the news. It’s there source of my entertainment. And my life will seem much emptier without it and I don’t know how my mental state would fair tbh."
I've changed from before. I've gotten more feeling. That makes sense :)
It helps me to become close with myself and to be happier with the decisions I make. I'm less angry and more prone to make better decisions.

"Most of the food that I put in this section were pre-packaged foods that had been opened (dips, spreads) that I don’t eat often, so it can easily get lost in the fridge. I will remember to eat them first by putting on the middle shelf in the front, and to buy only 1 hummus/guac at a time, so I don’t end up with half finished foods. "
We actually made a big meal out of most of our eat this first section and brought it to my grandmas to have for dinner! what’s left are veggies from our CSA to eat before our next pick up and the leftovers from tonight! We write notes on the fridge of “what’s in the fridge” so we know what we can grab super easily and whip up into a quick snack or meal
Nope
Definitely not the history I was taught in high school.
That we are still talking about structural racism. And even readers of the NYT aren't open enough to hearing it.
Nope! Never got close enough to recent times to see the more sinister racism. Things in the earlier American times were way downplayed too
"I remember reading these when they were first published. Reading them again makes me angrier... nothing has changed, and I want to move from reading and learning into action. I started learning and unlearning in 2014 after Michael Brown was murdered. Enough."
"I was definitely not taught about the depth and breadth of systemic racism in high school history courses. My high school is very diverse, but even within the school we experience some of the divides on who has access to private tutors or college counselors and who ends up taking AP classes. Baltimore County and City schools both suffer from the distribution of resources to schools from property taxes firsthand, but I never knew that as a student. There is also a huge issue in Baltimore due to the amount of people who leave the public school system and go to private school. In AP US history we covered a bare minimum of current policies in place that contribute to inequality in our society and I wish the curriculum focused on this as well. Over my years at UMD as a public policy student, I have gained so much more knowledge on how property taxes fund education and other areas of systemic racism that I have ever known before, and now my eyes are even more open. I am very interested in learning more about funding for education and housing to find solutions to improve these deeply rooted racist policies in Baltimore County and City. "
No. I was taught that Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves then MLK fought to give African-Americans basic human rights and won. I was never told about systemic racism even though I knew it existed I never knew what it was or how it was displayed.
This was one of the first things I saw and it was really impactful. Was literally the first time I ever heard of redlining. I think everyone should watch.
Not at all taught this- I am passing this video in to my kids to help them understand difference in the experience they are having vs their black friends at school.
Nope!
We were raging mostly white history. There is a whole Robison w my schools curriculum and I emailed a bunch of school board members and superintendents abt it but I think it’s gonna take more than that to create change. Education on these topics needs to start when the students are very young. The education system still has a ways to go.
"Nope. We constantly learned about WWII in history, early settlers to America (without discussion of stealing land), revolution stuff. We learned about genocides, but not the one in our own country. "
the income gap between whites and blacks is 40% bigger than in 1967!!!! in the midst of the civil rights era and now we’re worse
These are not things we were taught and what is frustrating is that even when presented with these facts people want to deny the current and real impact of systemic racism
"While going through the list, I reflected and thought: does this apply to me? I must reckon with my whiteness, but I must also acknowledge my native Mexican heritage. I’m half of each, and found myself recognizing my privilege in just about half of the list. 
This will be a difficult but necessary journey. "
We were not taught this history in school. I didn’t even know what systemic racism was until the past couple weeks. We learned the basics of the white washed slavery story but also that Columbus was not actually a hero like I learned when I was younger. AP US History really ignores systemic racism and true stories but thankfully my teacher would fill in some of the “blanks.” We also learned about the emancipation proclamation but never about Juneteenth which I think is ridiculous. We need to learn more Black and POC history in our school system.
"In HS, we didn’t explicitly learn about systemic racism. I don’t recall learning about redlining or any of the other polices that have prevented Black citizens from building wealth. When I think back, we learned about the Civil Rights, but there weren’t connections made to today. It was an incomplete history that left out a lot. "
"Absolutely not. I think redlining was briefly mentioned but I definitely did not fully understand the impact until I got to college. As I’m finding with many ugly parts of our history, our educational system fails to provide the full story - particularly when it comes to presenting the long term, present day consequences of that ugly history. For instance, I was in a district that bussed in black students from the city to come to a largely white surburan school. However, my understanding of this never extended to why there would be a need to do that on the first place. "
"I had seen this video before, and it shocks me how far back and how blatant racism in the past is still creating such inequality today. The white people who have come before me, all over the world disgust me by how they felt entitled, and were fully able to segregate and undermine black peoples lives and rights. Its so unfair, that for generations black families were turned away from housing rights, and the fact that just that one area had impacted generations existing now, and it makes it much more difficult to dismantle. I never realised the problem was quite this large before, and quite so difficult to change, but now I realise that no natter how many bigots and racists we oppose now, we still have to overcome the bigoted and racist system engrained in countries across the world, and therefore now is the time for major reform, and dismantling of the olds systems, to make up and level the playing field of a good life for black poeple.  It’s necessary for these systems to change because no one human, and certainly no entire race, should have to fight against so much, for such a basic thing as genuine human rights."
"My history books were written by wealthy, white men and other perspectives were not addressed. "
No
"These are definitely not things my teachers talked about. Of course we learned about racism, but it was always in the context of the past and not the present. This serves to highlight how important it is to recognize the systems that contribute to the systemic oppression of BIPOC every single day."
"No - largely the history was white male centered, with only the exceptional Black/female mentioned. "
How how how am I only reading this now!
"It’s interesting to me how much he talked about the economics of racism, to a degree he talked a little bit about de facto segregation within relationships/friendships for a second and then stop talking about it.  well of course parts of systemic racism are also economical and embedded in policy I think a lot of it is also the socialization of people based on their race. To be honest it also surprised me that he touched a lot on statistics that discussed and proved and validated systemic racism without actually ever using the word systemic racism (i think). I’m really interested to read the second half and see what else he has to say. "
I had never even heard of redlining! Let’s change the way schools are funded
"This is certainly not the history I was taught. I attended a private Jewish school which was composed of almost entirely white students and an almost entirely white faculty/staff. For us, the “inequality” we knew and spoke most about was between the wealthier and less wealthy students attending our school (who by the way are still very privileged and financially stable). We spoke about how some people could afford to pay private tutors for standardized testing and help in school, leading to a cycle of greater success for themselves and their children. Looking back on this, we had no idea how badly that reality was and that even the least privileged amongst us was  extremely privileged to be able to attend a private school with a great education and college counselors and much more. We were so focused on our own little bubble of privilege that we could not see the reality of the world around us and the disadvantage that so many students our age were at just because of the family they were born into. The extent of racism that was taught was slavery and Jim Crow laws. We were all under the impression that after Jim Crow ended, racism was solved in America. I had not heard the term red lining until after I graduated high school, and many of my high school friends also just recently learned what it meant. It is so important that we advocate for the reality of America’s history to be taught in school so that generations to come are more knowledgeable and less susceptible to fall into the pattern of racism that is founded on lies."
NO! this history was definitely not taught when i was growing up. i’ve seen this video multiple times now and it’s crazy to me each time because it’s so straight forward and depicts systemic racism so well. i feel it makes ALOT make more sense in regards to the parallels that we still see today. i personally feel like once you see this video you can’t help but act and you can’t see the world the same again.
History in high school and prior is all about the history of white people in America they write as though white people are the main characters and everything else is just an extra moving the story along. This happens with multiple races in the United States we preach diversity that we are the melting pot but we are taught from the beginning to conform to the white man and that anything is of a lesser importance.  Because in reality if we learned the history of all races in America the white man would lose his power and privileges.
"This were definitely parts of this video that were not included in my high school education. While we did learn about slavery and Jim Crow, it was heavily implied that those systems had no effect on the systems today. It would have been useful to understand how these systems impact our education and eventually the jobs we have. "
"We weren’t taught this in school, but rather lived it in elementary and middle school. It was jarring to move to a middle class city and see the differences that existed not 15 minutes away. "
No ma’am
Nope!
"I realise that I cannot just speak up when it is convenient to me, but that my anti-racism needs to be constant and continuous. Why? Because I am embarrassed I haven't always done more. Because I have learnt more. Because I'm angry. Because I know I can do better and I have to."
Really enjoyed reading the whole series. The unconscious bias is fascinating. I would like to keep exploring this bias and find ways to be more conscious in my own life

"I’m actually surprised with how down to earth this article was. First with the presentation of statistics which I think is one of the best ways to educate whites with white fragility but also bringing up the point about having black friends, family, just anyone close. I feel like people can read all they want about anti racism, but failing to see humanity in a real person, making that connection outside the pages... what exactly did you do? This is not to say that that we should have black friends to be more educated. It is not their responsibility to educate us. it’s just really important to ask ourselves, who are the people in my friend group? Why is it this way? Is it because of my own biases? Why are the people in my neighborhood all of a particular race? People who look like me? How does this relate to my part in racism Etc. "
"No, what I was taught in high school is if you work hard you can achieve anything. Myth of meritocracy. I was not taught that race is a social construct and that systems can be racist and oppressive. "
"I wasn’t taught about any of this in high school, though I feel My experience is a prime example of redlining, which I even contributed to by changing school systems. "
The 2011 survey about white people believing they suffer more from racism than black people. It also touched on the school to prison pipeline which I think is vital to understand in order to successfully make changes in this country.

"“The best escalator to opportunity may be education, but that escalator is broken for black boys growing up in neighborhoods with broken schools. We fail those boys before they fail us.”"
absolutely not. i love this video — i feel like it fills in the blanks to understand racism that might not be as obvious because it is so engrained
"I
"
I don’t think this was emphasized enough in my US history class.
"The video taught me way more than my history class ever would. Seeing the ways systemic racism is still imbedded in every day life is awful. Because of the color of their skin, and the way their ancestors were treated should not define who they are or what they are capable of doing. This is why people need to stand with them and find all the ways to remove systemic racism from their lives. "
"I wasn’t taught one bit of this in high school, even though my school was located right near a dividing line between richer neighborhoods to the north and poorer neighborhoods to the south."
Nope not at all. A bit in college but didn’t really sink in.
"I was taught white washed history to be sure. Eurocentric history that diminished the achievements of anyone other than white settlers. We didn’t even really learn about the civil rights movement because we’d never get that far in history because we’d spend so much time on the Civil War, which I was taught was because of states rights despite what seemed obvious to me at the time...that it was about slavery. Couldn’t understand why people we’re defending the Southern states, especially in my Northern state. Still don’t, really."
Of course not! I’ve seen this video before and it does an excellent job of explaining systemic racism.
"-Acknowledge that the effects of slavery & the Jim Crow laws are still effecting access for opportunity today
-Support systemic changes: reform criminal justice system, end predatory lending, protect voting rights, increase public school funding for wealthy & poor schools, etc.
..... definitely not taught all of this in high school history. I mean we were taught some of it, but so little that I don’t even remember learning it. "
"Systemic Racism video:
This is definitely not the history we were taught in school. I didn't learn about any of this until I actively sought it out as an adult.
Someone posted a ""rebuttal"" this video by Ben Shapiro, who is a well researched right winged conservative. While watching the video, I noticed he makes some really good points and does his research,  however there were still holes in his logic which is very satisfying for me the position I take."
I didn’t know that public schools were so heavily reliant on property taxes
No we weren’t taught black history at all but I feel this is vital in future curriculums
"This was absolutely not the history I was taught in school. I think we were taught the very basics of racism but it wasn’t even really called that. We learned about slavery and the emancipation proclamation and then we learned about the civil rights movement in the 60s. Nothing in between and nothing about how problematic anything any president did was. We didn’t learn that Lincoln only emancipated enslaved people for the benefit of the war. We didn’t talk about redlining in the New Deal. The more I think back, the more I realize that not only did we only barely scratch the surface on learning about racism and inequalities, there weren’t very many people of color to even call out the teachers. But again the responsibility shouldn’t just fall on BIPOC but on everyone and even if there are pEople of all races, religions, ethnicities and sexualities in the room, we shouldn’t expect everyone to be familiar with history. That’s why we have a history class in the first place. We trust our educators to be honest and give us the whole history but the reality is that there is so so much being left out and it’s hard to accept that the people we trusted weren’t there to teach us everything. Just what benefitted is to know. But it doesn’t benefit us. It only benefits us if it’s the whole truth. "
I was surprised about the wealth gap being even higher than apartheid South Africa.
Never learned about systemic racism until I took my social justice issues class for my major last year! Its crazy to me how public schools arent including this important topic in mainstream curriculum
This was not the history I was taught during high school. I remember learning about implicit biases only briefly in an elective psychology course. I remember learning about redlining only as a vocabulary term and not really understanding the deep rooted history of predatory lending and the intentional segregation of America's cities by its government.
"I’ve learned a tiny bit about systemic racism in history class this year, but not a lot. mostly just learning about it through things like these and educating myself. my school is just like kevin’s, the wealthiest in the district funded by the wealthiest people in the district "
"I don’t think I ever learned about this in school. And even if we did talk about racism it was confined to the 60s and was HISTORY class so no one thought to think of it as today’s problem. There’s a lot that I feel I already *kind of* knew, because much of this does not come as a surprise. But hearing it laid out and so clearly inequitable is just scary to see"
History and even social studies never touched on this reality or even really alluded to the clear discrepancy between white and black realities and the systemic racism that has and continues to affect us today.
"Reading these statistics and a) imagining how much more staggering they probably are now or b) realizing they haven’t changed much and that’s still awful! 
While it’s disheartening that none of those statistics were that surprising (except the one in the beginning that the racial wealth gap in America is MORE than what is was in South Africa during the apartheid - that’s insane!) the last bit of the article was heartening! It is imperative that we recognize our progress and at the same time recognize the challenges ahead. They can coexist and that progress can help inspire us to address those challenges! 
While it really does feel daunting at how MANY challenges lie ahead, it provides a bit, even if it is just the tiniest bit, of hope!"
"In the past I was young and naive, I thought that everything would've worked itself out. Unfortunately, this isn't how it works. What's different now is I'm more self-aware and I know that I have unearned privilege where people of colour do not. I understand now more than ever that it is my duty to educate myself on these issues and use my voice as an ally to help stand up for my brothers and sisters, and educate those around me."
Not at all. This is not what I was taught. I was thought thy black communities had more violence because they were “gangsters” or “thugs” but never the racism and systems that played into that view
"Honestly, the first reading didn't shock me too much. While it is deeply troubling and saddening, I am not shocked that most white people are offended by the news coverage and want it to go away. "
They don’t teach this in school
"That whites, on average, believed that anti-white racism was a bigger problem than anti-black racism!! Are you kidding me?!!!! 
I am appalled and ashamed, I just can’t seem to find the words to express the feelings inside of me when I read things like this. I am definitely guilty of not seeing (or not wanting to see, I guess) just how deep anti-black attitudes permeate EVERY INCH OF OUR SOCIETY AND OUR LAWS. But to ever think WE experience the most racism, that is utterly preposterous and so damn ignorant. Gross. I know you can’t necessarily change an individual’s personal bias or racist views, that we have to focus on changing the policies. But it makes me sick to know that obviously many of my fellow Americans believe bullshit like this. Makes me beyond angry and extremely sad. But mostly, beyond angry.      🤬😡🤬"
I had watched this video several time already and new about this.  I have thought for many year how we fund our schools are racist policies.  I shared the video on my Class Dojo and most parents viewed and liked it.  Getting the word out is important.
"The disparity in household income between average black families and white families was very surprising to me.  Having grown up in the middle class and around other middle class people, I wouldn’t have expected the difference to be so great. The quote from Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke to me because I’ve often been nervous of being robbed/attacked and it’s disgusting but i was always more nervous of black people on the sidewalk for latinx more than white. I sicken myself for ever feeling that way. I want to blame the media but it’s my own shortcomings for feeling that way. "

This video reminded me once again how interlinked the systems in society are in upholding white privilege. It’s crazy to think how something as simple as your name or the fact that you grew up on a certain street determines so much of how the institutions in society will give you. Something that shocked me a lot was when he talked about banks being more likely to give money to low income white families than to higher income black families.
I’m shocked to see the income disparity is so wide. It made me squirm to think about how many black friends I have (not many). Do I need to have black friends to have empathy and take action? No. But I do worry that I’ll misstep or overstep without direct perspectives from people of color.
"No surprised but reminded of this truth ""many young people of color see no hope of getting ahead, and that despair can be self-fulfilling."" I can work to provide hope through donations, volunteering, and attention."
"It has changed over the years, but for the worse. And the illusion that racism has been getting better is nothing more than that... an illusion"

"It begins with a shared activity that we can both enjoy. For me, I’d LOVE if she learned to play Magic so we could share a game or two together. Then we would walk to M Greenpoint (RIP) for some delicious Chinese food. Then we would come and spend some shared time with Winona. 

I’d love if Allison asked me some questions and we started to engage on topics that I learn towards: cards, games, maybe sports."
"The easy answer is the internet. I mean nothing has changed our world more in the past 50 years. Its made the works infinitely more connected and enabled all types of “good” things (education, communication, convenience, etc) but its also brought a lot of bad things too, right? And most change doesn’t necessarily mean “best”. 

I think maybe renewable energy sources  just as a whole? It’s nowhere near finalized or fully implemented but at least it’s starting to gain traction throughout the world. "
"MICROWAVE POPCORN. I mean can you imagine a world without it where you wouldn’t be able to have the worlds best snack in 3 minutes or less on demand? I wouldn’t want to live in so bleak of a world. Microwave popcorn is the most comforting snack that makes movies, Zoom calls, etc. 1000x more enjoyable. Really it’s one of the most simple but most technologically advanced foods that is a wonder to behold. It’s definitely up there for best invention."
"We would start by visiting the museum we've been to once already. After spending ~1 1/2 hours learning more about the history of ""red"" Vienna, we would go home, have sex, take a shower, get dressed again and go out to eat at a vegan restaurant. Afterwards, we would take a walk to a nice bar and get some drinks. Thereupon, we would go home, have some more sex and fall asleep in each others arms.❤️
Alternatively, about ~1 week before, we would both pick a topic we are interested in and would like to know more about. Then we both research each others topic, prepare some form of presentation and explain it the next time we see each other. Before doing so, we would make a lasagna together and eat dinner. After we are done presenting and discussing each others topics, we would take a nice relaxing bath together before taking it to the bedroom.

Another idea would be learning a new skill together/ improving it. Dancing, programming, sculpting, playing an instrument, drawing,..."

"Racism and classic have both been factors in the over incarceration of Black men and boys. Also, keeping people in jail because they are too poor to post bail is so problematic. We must do more to decriminalize Marijuana charges and other misdemeanor charges. The Justice system is a mess and needs a restructuring. "
"I think that, unfortunately, there has always been this push by people in power (especially in America) to criminalize Black people. As we see in this video, even the people we celebrate today for fighting for equal rights were seen as criminals while they were fighting. It is such a sad part of our society and one that has led to things like mass incarceration along with the war on drugs and police brutality. As sad as it is, we will not progress as a society until we address this issue and talk about what it would mean to move our resources away from for-profit prisons and over-budgeted police departments and toward community resources that would help people instead of criminalizeing them. "
"I have recently begun to identify societal issues regarding policing as the call to refund the police rises. I first thought that the answer was more social services, but after exploring the problems caused by child services and the United states’ history or the removal of children from their homes for ""bad"" living conditions or whatever the case may be has changed my mind. Yes, decriminalize mental illness's and help people get through them. Yes, provide assistance for drug abuse. We have to reframe our society's priorities. A barrier to this plan is that Republicans are very much against the idea that equality in monetary and health care exist. They believe that they will lose their privileges and do not care what happens to the lower classes. They cannot see past their worries to realize the injustices imposed on the lower classes. They cannot understand that allowing lowered classes to gain basic necessities will help them in the long run.  Most worry about their capitalistic gains and that any changes would hinder their money making abilities."

How do we reform a system that’s been build on racist ideals.

"Changing the mindset that as the author says, “black people are seen as a race that are believed to be more criminally active”"
I knew about the for-profit prisons but I didn’t make the connection that their location affected the rates at which Black Americans are incarcerated.  I’ll have to educate myself on that.
"I have never heard about Dynamite Hill, I will be looking it up as soon as I finish this entry! Since I have really been spending a lot of time actually looking at racism and the history of this country (including policing), I am familiar with the others. I just want to keep learning. As much as I can. My eyes are open, and there’s no going back to sleep.💪🏼"
"I think it’s shocking how false an image we have of prisons and offenders, specifically black offenders today in society. The huge numbers of black men being sentenced to incarceration paints a picture that they are rightfully there because they are more inclined as a race to crime. But that’s not true. The Caucasian race is just more inclined to treating societal issues, that disproportionately affect people of colour, and the impact of these as crimes that would not be crimes in a white context. There is such a significant correlation between mental health, unemployment, social or economic position, along with many others things, and serving time in prison, but these correlations are more prominent when there is a person of colour in question. White people whose crimes may be attributed to mental health may get shorter sentences or none at all, instead being sent to an appropriate institution to help them, but black people in the same situation are forced to suffer. People of colour also have larger numbers of people living in poverty, or unemployed, not because they’re incapable, lazy, inept or criminal, but because decades of white rule and white supremacy has forced them into their positions, and therefore crime occurs because of there situation, not their race. There is no reason to believe that if the tables were turned a large percentage of white people would not act in ‘criminal’ ways because of necessity or situation, because it’s not about their race, but about their position. If these problems received attention, for example community outreach and support, ensuring a decrease of prejudices in job selection, along with a series of other actions that would support BIPOC communities that do not receive the same respect or support that predominantly white communities do, then it is highly likely if not certain that crime would decrease. Furthermore if the police, penal and criminal justice were re-educated, reformed (or abolished in police’s case) to ensure they are less racist, and biased against giving unnecessary time or unnecessarily long time for BIPOC offenders/‘offenders’ then we would also see these numbers decrease. The idea that more BIPOC people are in prison because they are inclined to criminal behaviour is harmful and untrue. More BIPOC people are in prison because they are not at any level being treated with the same respect, consideration and support as their white counterparts are, and therefore received more frequent and more harsh punishments for equal or less bad offences.

"Defunding police and prison abolition are the only way out of this unjust system. This made me think about Willie, Aliquippa and the closure of the mill, and the rest of the broken social contract in my hometown. I need to continue my commitments."
"I’ve thought a lot about how physical health issues are criminalized for Black people, like HIV and COVID, but knew less about the historical basis for Black people’s mental health criminalization."
"There are a few factors this system of racial control including the 13th amendment, war on drugs, and policing to target Black communities. Public health problems like addiction (aka drug use which is illegal for many substances and Black individuals often receive higher sentences), education (lack of education -> lack of jobs -> forced into redlined areas (because race and income) and then in these neighborhoods that are targeted), and more. I think there are ways to end this cycle by providing more resources to communities that need them. More education, mental and physical healthcare, policing reconstruction (and defunding) and funds to support families would really help to break this cycle. "
Good video. Was hard to find. Wish it was longer.

I thought this was a very good breakdown of the history of white supremacy in regards to police (though it did skip a huge chunk of time between the civil war and Jim Crow). I am on the lookout for more resources like this that help identify the cause of some of the issues we see in our society today. A lot of videos that use a lot of statistics about how it is for the Black community today are easily thwarted by those of differing opinions because they don’t understand the racist roots.

I had no idea until very recently that Black women’s hair was such a site of contestation and racism. I will speak up if I see someone reaching to touch a Black woman’s hair.
They are not challenges I’ve ever faced. I think that (without trying to lump everybody into the same experience) I can keep this in mind when trying to be more inclusive with others and interacting with others.
"My looks have always been an advantage, from my whiteness to my attractiveness as a young woman. This video was impactful. It’s a keeper. "
"No I haven’t. Help them to feel heard, seen and appreciated the way they are. "
"""Yeah but you're hir can't do that"" I didn't know how big if an issue this was. Just because others don't understand your hair they make you feel bad! Black girls aren't dating young because people didnt view them as beautiful. The media doesn't revier black women as beautiful enough. They need to be told more. 
I have never faced a hair issue aside from my hair being too thick for certain stylists to handle. However that is a typically a compliment and not an issue. I have faced the issue if being the only brown person in the room or in the group and not fitting in, not feeling beautiful enough. I think now it has much more to do with my weight than the color of my skin, but that's another issue. I am sad that I have never had close black girl friends in my life. I'm not usually one to give out compliments to people, but I do smile and I would like to go out of my way to smile or say hi or actually compliment the black girl in a room especially if we are the only POC in the room."
These are not challenges I face - other than the ones that are common to women under patriarchy. I reaffirm my commitment to using my voice on behalf of others.
"I actually want to try to meditate! There’s a reason why it’s hard and we all struggle to not be able to stop thinking and relax. I find that so problematic and I want to try to fix that!

This stood out to me because it highlights that there really is always more to learn. Even for people like us who are working to draw attention to race relations and systemic racism, we still do not have the full picture and won’t be able to take in every single staticstic or piece of information we see.

"Most shocking quotes for me from the article:
-“whites, on average, believed that anti-white racism was a bigger problem than anti-black racism.” I know this is from 2011 survey and I hope this has changed
-“The net worth of the average black household in the United States is $6,314, compared with $110,500 for the average white household, according to 2011 census data. The gap has worsened in the last decade, and the United States now has a greater wealth gap by race than South Africa did during apartheid. “ I was aware of the racial wealth gap but seeing the numbers and comparison to South Africa’s wealth inequities during apartheid is startling"
"I had seen this video before, and it shocks me how far back and how blatant racism in the past is still creating such inequality today. The white people who have come before me, all over the world disgust me by how they felt entitled, and were fully able to segregate and undermine black peoples lives and rights. Its so unfair, that for generations black families were turned away from housing rights, and the fact that just that one area had impacted generations existing now, and it makes it much more difficult to dismantle. I never realised the problem was quite this large before, and quite so difficult to change, but now I realise that no natter how many bigots and racists we oppose now, we still have to overcome the bigoted and racist system engrained in countries across the world, and therefore now is the time for major reform, and dismantling of the olds systems, to make up and level the playing field of a good life for black poeple.  It’s necessary for these systems to change because no one human, and certainly no entire race, should have to fight against so much, for such a basic thing as genuine human rights. Kill"
"That white people think anti-
white racism is a bigger problem than anti-black racism"
"I was surprised by many of the statistics showing how anti-Black racism is in many ways worse today than it was in the 1960s. This isn’t exactly “surprising” based on what I’ve seen in this country, but it’s shocking to see the statistics written so plainly when they are so often hidden from white people to continue the charade of equality. "
"I didn't realize the gap was so large. It shouldn't be so shocking, but white privilege is a huge buffer. To see a comparison with apartheid South Africa really drove that home. Americans are clear on apartheid being horrible, so it's frustrating that we're able to ignore racism so much closer."
How how how am I only reading this now!
"I was shocked by the large percentage of people who believed that anti-white racism was more prevalent in America than anti-Black racism. Over the past few weeks I have heard that some people here and there believe in this “reverse racism,” however I was unaware of how widespread that belief was. It is hard for me to grasp that so many of us white people are so ignorant about our privilege that we actually think WE are the ones at a disadvantage. It truly speaks to the heart of the issue at hand, which is immense ignorance and blindness to the truth of the Black experience in America."
NO! this history was definitely not taught when i was growing up. i’ve seen this video multiple times now and it’s crazy to me each time because it’s so straight forward and depicts systemic racism so well. i feel it makes ALOT make more sense in regards to the parallels that we still see today. i personally feel like once you see this video you can’t help but act and you can’t see the world the same again.
"The race problem is not anti-white racism!


• The net worth of the average black household in the United States is $6,314, compared with $110,500 for the average white household, according to 2011 census data. The gap has worsened in the last decade, and the United States now has a greater wealth gap by race than South Africa did during apartheid. 


Indeed, a 2011 study by scholars at Harvard and Tufts found that whites, on average, believed that anti-white racism was a bigger problem than anti-black racism."
"I think what surprised me the most is that so many people said that anti-white racism was a bigger issue than anti-Black racism. To me, it seems so obvious that this is untrue, but it clearly is not to a lot of people. This is yet another hurdle that has to be overcome on the path to anti-racism. Especially since the article shows us that white people tend not to have many Black friends, it becomes even more difficult to persuade the uninformed. When these disparities are so clear, it can become disheartening to see so many people still not understanding. But it should be part of our job to help educate people and show them exactly what is wrong and what needs to change. "
The part about the lady throwing out the receipt.  I just never would have thought about that

"I’m actually surprised with how down to earth this article was. First with the presentation of statistics which I think is one of the best ways to educate whites with white fragility but also bringing up the point about having black friends, family, just anyone close. I feel like people can read all they want about anti racism, but failing to see humanity in a real person, making that connection outside the pages... what exactly did you do? This is not to say that that we should have black friends to be more educated. It is not their responsibility to educate us. it’s just really important to ask ourselves, who are the people in my friend group? Why is it this way? Is it because of my own biases? Why are the people in my neighborhood all of a particular race? People who look like me? How does this relate to my part in racism Etc. "
"I was most surprised by the disparity between black and white average income - both because of the size of the gap and also because $6k is hardly enough to live on.

This is why our generation needs to be the change and remove racial bias from schools, minds, and overall America. "
It’s surprising to think of how little has changed since Ferguson. That white people were feeling targeted by racism helps explain how our country went from a Black President when these pieces were written to the most racist white leader many of us who are Gen X have ever known.

-White people often focus on the Black people who have “made it” (i.e. President Obama) so they look at this as progressive & see racism as a thing of the past

"Kristofs: ""Why Whites just don't get it"" article-

What surprised me the most was the statistic about the weath gap and comparing it to the apartheid in South Africa. After reading Trevor Noah's Born a Crime, I learned a lot about apartheid and the discrimination in South Africa. I was shocked to see that in 2014, our wealth gap was larger than theirs. Whites owned 18times more than blacks in America in 2014, while in South Africa whites owned 15 times more during apartheid. 
That was shocking because I couldn't imagine living in South Africa with what they were going through and how it was literally a crime for black and white people to be together so recently. People think America is so progressive and doing great, but if we were why is the wealth gap like this? Do other countries have such a difference in regards to race? "
We need to actively not live around all white people
I don’t think I’m surprised by all the implicit bias Kristof writes about because that is the most glaringly obvious thing I’ve noticed. However the crosswalk thing really shocked me. The thing about implicit bias that shocked me the most was how deep it really goes. The fact that White people had cars stop earlier for them than Black people is shocking to me because there’s so little time to even contemplate stopping at crosswalks that the biases must run so deep it’s not something someone would look at and go “hey that’s racist.” I don’t know if this thought bubble is making sense but it really shocked me. Like I know that these biases exist but for it to be so deeply embedded in people that crosswalks come into play really shocks me
That black people somehow deserve to be treated poorly.
Immediately upon beginning the series I was SHOCKED to see that a 2011 study (only 9 years ago!!!!) said that whites were more concerned about anti-white racism than anti-black racism. That is absolutely astounding and shows how oblivious white people are to struggles of black people and other POC in America.
"I guess it surprised me because I felt like all whites know about racism. Whether they purposely were racist/a white supremacist, or just knew and didn’t care enough to help because they were at the advantage. They title popped out to me because it said “white just don’t get it”. honestly surprised me that some whites don’t even know about racism. like how? the facts are there, now research and make a change!

"I already knew that there were white ppl who think anti - white racism is not only a thing but a lingering reality that affects them to their core. But hearing a study that cemented that in droves was so disheartening.

Reflection
Something I was taught: that the civil rights era ended in the 60s.
It’s abundantly clear that civil rights were not fully granted in our society once the CRA was passed. Seeing those pictures of black folks being sprayed by fire hoses and letting police dogs on them was horrifying g and in a sense that explicit visual of racism has ended but there are innumerable ways that our society is still so racist. It’s embarassing thst it took me so long to see what’s happening in ourpresent day when I’ve felt so empowered by reading how horrible things were in the past. And thinking about how far we’ve come. I need to keep remembering everyday that we are not beyond racism or what the civil rights movement was working for. We are still in the same mess, we’ve just done a better job at hiding it and making our systems even more implicitly racist."

The net worth of the average black household in the United States is $6,314, compared with $110,500 for the average white household. The gap has worsened in the last decade, and the United States now has a greater wealth gap by race than South Africa did during apartheid. (Whites in America on average own almost 18 times as much as blacks; in South Africa in 1970, the ratio was about 15 times.)
The black-white income gap is roughly 40 percent greater today than it was in 1967.

What surprised me the most was just the fact that it was written 6 years ago and absolutely nothing has changed
"I am working to unlearn sooooo much. I am lucky enough to have forward thinking parents who really instilled my whole life that we are all one. I grew up in very racially diverse neighborhoods, attended schools that were the same. But racism comes at us from all directions, and being white, there are many things I have taken for granted or just didn’t investigate because it wasn’t my reality. So not racist was a term I prided myself on, but it’s just a mask. That was a powerful thing to read and digest. But it’s true. You have to actively FIGHT racism. As far as the things we are taught in school, that is an absolute farce. The fact that we teach these completely untrue tales of how our great nation was built and leave out much mention of anything that isn’t celebrating the White man, it’s no wonder we ended up here really. Behind changing policy, changing the educational system is a big piece of moving toward social equity. "
I agree and see the racism that is present.
"From a young age(from family and from tv/movies) I’ve heard people talk about and refer to the “All-American girl.” Which was a term always used to describe a blonde, white woman. As small as that may seem, I’ve been trying to make myself realize now that that blonde white woman isn’t the all american girl and how narrow a field that is for people of color to never be able to fit in. This seems dumb now that I wrote it out but that’s a thing I’ve worked on. Like tom pettys song “American Girl”, how many people hear that and assume he’s talking about a black woman with an Afro? 

Ways I will commit to being an anti-racist
Continue to talk to my family about their racist ideals and actions. 
Identify and change my own racist ideals. 
Continue reading and educating myself on systemic racism and how white supremacy rules America. 
Donate to local BIPOC organizations when I’m able to. 
Diversify my IG feed and my resources and support small BIPOC businesses and address why I haven’t been doing so longer.

"In part 6 when he talked about why people discriminate, i think he made a very important point because up until recently, most people believed that racism was just full out hateful actions instead of the various micro-aggressions that actually uphold this system.

"That is an interesting question but in my opinion it's incredibly hard to answer. Since 1970, so many important things in so many different sectors have been invented. I don't think I am in a position to say which sector is the most important, let alone which invention. A lot of inventions are present in our day-to-day life but aren't crucial for surviving. Does that make them less important/good than life-saving inventions? I don't know. Probably. On the other hand, we are unable to know what kind of world we would live in if these everyday items wouldn't have been invented. So maybe they are life-saving in some indirect way. I am certain it is not the best invention of the last 50 years, but one thing that came to my mind was the DNA fingerprint. It was invented/discovered (by accident!) by Alec Jeffreys. Everyone has a different set of genes and the areas in the DNA called minisatellites are unique to each person. Kind of like a bar code for each individual. Countless murders and other crimes have been solved by this method, so this invention contributed greatly to making this world more just. I think it is incredible, but of course you should stay critical. Even Jeffreys himself said that it should never be used on innocent people. It would be mortifiying if the government had a DNA fingerprint of every citizen. The risk of this invention being used in immoral, controlling ways is definitely existent and we can only hope that it won't turn into a real threat."

"I had not heard of Dynamite Hill until today. I had not heard of Slave Patrols, the Black Wall Street Massacare, or qualified immunity until about a month ago when I started this anti racist process. Clearly, there is so much history that has not been taught to us in school that many of us have not learned until recently. I would like to learn more about reallocation of ploice funds. There have been a lot of different attempts and propositions to defund the police, and I hope that organizations can find ways to make these proposals a reality and explain them in a practical way that can help people understand them and help the communities they serve be safer. "
How do we dismantle the system. What steps need to be taken to reallocate funds to communities? How do we address mental health checks?
I did not know about Dynamite Hill. The fact that so many white supremacists bombed a neighborhood that it earned a nickname is absolutely horrifying. We need to be learning about these things in school so that we can be better educated about the history of our country.
"I grew up with the belief that the police were there to protect me. Call them when you need them and they will be there to help. After events over the past few years and seeing the destruction of BIPOC and learning about the way that policd are trained and how they decide to handle protests with violence, I do not feel the same way. I find myself thinking what situations might be like if I were a person of color in many different situations when cops are around. I was in the grocery store the other day and carried my groceries out without a bag and I had the receipt in my purse. I couldn't help but wonder if the lady standing at the entrance/exit to Walmart would have stopped me to see the receipt if I were a person of color. I have begun writing letters to local officials to request they change their policies of policing even though I don't believe they will change. I still have to try. "

People will still be drawn to professions for racist reasons."
"I do not have any law enforcement in my family, or in my circle of friends. So my relationship with the police pretty much consists of run-ins in my youth and seeing them brutalize people on television. Even being a White woman, I knew which cities to stay out of because of the notorious reputation of their police force. In my 20’s, I hung out with lots of punks (as in punk rockers!), and they definitely got hassled and abused. So if I witnessed all of that, then you know it’s 1,000 worse for people of color. We have allowed the police to turn into this militarized, untouchable monster that does whatever the hell it pleases and terrorizes anyone within their circle if they dare speak up. 

My interpretation has changed in the sense that our policing system is WAY worse than I could have ever imagined. This is the subject I’ve learned the most about since I started my anti-racism journey. With every article, podcast, documentary, book, and show I watch on the subject I am more appalled. This much power should never have been given to a group of under trained people, and they are not going to give that power up easily. I think of it like a child who has gotten away with doing whatever they want and then suddenly they are shown discipline. They FREAK OUT. That’s what we are already seeing, cops calling out sick and not just outright not showing up to 911 calls. Temper tantrums. I mean why the hell would they want things to change, the system works pretty great for them! There definitely are some amazing officers out there, and I am thankful to have them to call on when I’m in need. I’m lucky, I’m the right color. But without transparency, accountability, and officers standing up when “the bad apples” are terrorizing the communities we pay them to serve and protect, things will not change. I know this is wordy, but I’m fired up! 🔥 "
"I was aware of most of these things and the evolution of the slave patrols into official police in America, and think it’s just absolutely atrocious. I definitely think I need to look into how it was set up in the UK, as I suspect it’s not dissimilar to the US in it’s racist roots. It’s shocking to know that most of us are unaware of the racist origins of so many things, or don’t acknowledge that those can still affect the world and structures today. DEFUND THE POLICE."

"The war on crime is so misleading as to the average white person it seems like a great fight to support. However, I now know that the war on crime is really just a war on Black people. “Crime” is used synonymously with Black people, almost like a euphemism. I want to learn more about qualified immunity and it’s effects today. I know that it protects law enforcement even when they are committing crimes against Black people in many cases, and I would like to look farther into it and into alternatives."

That was great. Easily digestible and informative.
"Absolutely it’s changed, or at least it will (I haven’t yet had a direct encounter). My relationship has simply been to comply and listen, to fear repercussions but not be afraid of losing my life. Most times have been during driving and being pulled over, which have typically resulted in a ticket but ended fine and just left me pissed off at the rudeness I encountered, but once again I never feared for my life and wondered if I’d return home. Rather, I feared disappointing someone. "
"I’ve never really encountered the police before, not really. I feel very lucky that I haven’t had a run in, but also know that if I did it would likely end up fine. I’m more aware of police presence now, and aware that I need to pay attention to who the police are stopping, to hold our community leaders accountable, and to make sure that the police are serving all."

"I couldn't imagine living life without...

My belief in the power of working together.

I've always considered collaborative thought humanity's true superpower. Not dexterity, not stamina, not even raw intelligence (though of course, collaborative thought requires some intelligence). We've proven time and time again that we, as a species, have the ability to make any number of great and terrible things happen - that we aren't fully beholden to what the universe throws at us - that we can in fact make the universe beholden to us.

And that's both a reason for great hope and great fear. Everything that's happened since the turn of the millennium has only proven how powerful our collective thoughts can be. We make material value out of hope. We mobilize hearts and minds with images and words. We make the untrue true. There's practically no limit to what we can do save for the laws of physics themselves (and maybe not even that).

We are powerful, and we got to where ever it is we are together.

All of these ideas mean a great deal to me personally, as well.

Not too long ago, I probably would've fancied myself as a good lone wolf: not really needing anyone, but still happy to have others around. I thought I was built to go at it alone. I'm an introvert, and I felt that I was okay by myself, interacting with who I wanted and nobody else. I also had a fair bit of (probably misplaced) confidence in myself. 

In short, I might have been exactly the kind of person who WOULDN'T care much about humanity as a whole. I could have very easily have fallen into the ideas that individual greatness is all that matters, and that people do good by contributing to the achievements of great men - ideas that I can now say I absolutely detest.

For whatever reason, I didn't turn out like that, and I can't be more grateful. When I say I can't imagine living without my belief in people, what I'm really saying is that I can't imagine living without the people who are the reason why I believe in people. I have them to thank.

I still have work to do. While I for absolute certain realize the value of other people, many of my responses to stress still involve closing myself off - never fully, but still fairly significantly. These past few months have made that very clear.

I think it would do me good to keep that in mind all the time. Other people are the reason I believe what I believe. My beliefs are strong, but they can't just stay beliefs. True to what I was saying in the beginning of this journal: ideas and beliefs are only truly real and powerful when they're shared. I have to do that more."

"The words I'd like to live by is ""be kind"". I think there can never be enough kindness in the world, and a little can go a long way. These things create ripple effects, and sometimes they have effects beneath the surface. 

I'd always like to be kind, maybe because I have experienced a lot of kindness myself? Or, more possibly, I have experienced the opposite of kindness very keenly. I am afraid that I attribute too many things to my dad, but I do somewhat attribute that to him. 

I'd like to say I practice this as much as I can, but I'm sure I can practice it more, do more for other people. Or maybe I'm not too sure. It is tiring too, and yes, sometimes you're taken advantage of. But I always think of it as me being in the right, and if they do take advantage of my kindness, it is not my fault. I did what was right.

I want to spread a sort of joy in the world from the kindness. To show that there still is good even in the darkest places. "

"Something I was taught growing up that I am trying to unlearn is that racism was ended when the Civil Rights Movement happened. In school, history classes make it seem like after that era, everything was great in the world and racism no longer existed. While there has been great progress since the 1960s, racism is far from over and simply has presented itself in new forms (and old ones have persisted as well). The era of mass incarceration is one of the most clearly defined examples of how racism continues to impact the lives of millions, but we are never really taught about this in depth in high school. Police brutality, voter suppression, and redlining are some other ways we see racism more prominent than ever. In the past decade a new understanding that racism is far from over due to social media exposure and increased coverage has allowed a lot of people to take a step back and realize this. "

"Something I was “taught” growing up was color blindness. I think I wrote about this a couple days ago but I grew up trying not to acknowledge color and differences. Now, I realize that color blindness is counterintuitive. It is not being anti-racist it’s more like how the article described standing on a moving sidewalk, not walking the other way. Ignoring race and different ethnicities ignores the pain and discrimination these individuals face. It ignores that there is a systemic problem in the US. I also didn’t know what systemic racism was growing up and didn’t know that racism is so ingrained in every part of our society whether it’s housing, education, and more. It’s so important to walk the other way on the moving side walk, against the “norm” of silence and help ensure everyone is treated equitably and equally.

"“To be an anti-racist, Kendi and others say, requires an understanding of history — an understanding that racial disparities in America have their roots, not in some failing by people of color but in policies that serve to prop up white supremacy.”

“Asked to define anti-racism, writer and middle-school teacher Christina Torres cited Beverly Daniel Tatum’s conception of racism as a moving walkway. “We’re all on the moving walkway,” Torres said. “If you’re not racist, you’re kind of just standing still on the moving walkway, but you’re still complicit in societal racism because you’re part of society.”

“The only way to be anti-racist is to walk in the other direction,” Torres said.”

"I think that previously I was non-racist, leaning more on the side of anti-racist. I had some conversations when the arose, and was prepared to combat blatant racism when I saw it. That wasn’t good enough. The phrase that stood out to me in this article was that white peoples favourite excuse is that they ‘didnt know’, and I can’t help but agree this is the reality. I needed to educate myself on racism in every form, so that I could more actively combat it when it was needed because, I genuinely didn’t know, but that isn’t good enough. Even if I had good intentions I have to educate myself thoroughly on racism a and how I can be actively anti-racist."

Something I’m working to unlearn is the idea that if someone isn’t overtly racist, then they aren’t racist at all. I’m unlearning the idea that covert racism doesn’t exist, because it’s real and just as dangerous as overt racism. "
White supremacist policies are intertwined with capitalism. Capitalism is taught as a good system but the US isn't a meritocracy. It's all about money.

"But as Kendi also notes, it’s not enough to simply be “not racist.” “The opposite of ‘racist’ isn’t ‘not racist,’” he writes. “It is ‘antiracist.’”


Anti-racism involves “taking stock of and eradicating policies that are racist, that have racist outcomes,” Ranganathan said, “and making sure that ultimately, we’re working towards a much more egalitarian, emancipatory society.”

Anti-racism is understanding how years of federal, state, and local policies have placed communities of color in the crises they face today, and calling those policies out for what they are: racist.

It also requires an understanding of one’s own position in a racist society, many say, an acknowledgment that you can’t simply opt out of living in white supremacy by saying you’re “not a racist” — you have to actively fight against it. “Anti-racism is an acknowledgment of privilege in a way that, I think, simply disavowing racism is not,” Ranganathan said. “It takes seriously that we all are situated into different matrices of power and privilege, and the first step is to take stock of that and not to disavow it or invisibilize it.”



Asked to define anti-racism, writer and middle-school teacher Christina Torres cited Beverly Daniel Tatum’s conception of racism as a moving walkway. “We’re all on the moving walkway,” Torres said. “If you’re not racist, you’re kind of just standing still on the moving walkway, but you’re still complicit in societal racism because you’re part of society.”


But it’s not the job of people of color to educate white people about racism or anti-racism. “I’m the victim of racism, and now you want me to try to solve the problem,” Simmons says she recently told colleagues. “The problem does not lie within me, it lies within the system that you benefit from.”


It’s also about identifying the teachers, politicians, and thought leaders who are working against these policies. “To be anti-racist would be to give support to these actors, and to throw your weight behind these organizations and these types of conversations,” Ranganathan explained."
"“All these constitute not a black problem or a white problem, but an American problem”"
"When I was growing up, I was told that if you worked really hard then you would succeed. For the most part, that has worked for me in the past. But, I still am unlearning this idea because for many people that do work hard, it is still not possible for them to get what they need. I used to think a lot about how hard I worked in high school and how that was the reason I got such good grades. But I also did not have to work, or take care of family members, or worry about anything besides school work. This was especially exposed during the pandemic. I still have a tendency to think about just how hard I work and attribute that to my academic success, but i have to realize that I am also very privileged to only have to focus on school. I used to be a big supporter of the idea of meritocracy, whether I realized it or not. I now see why that is wrong, but I still have that bias to unlearn when it comes to my daily thought process. "

Growing up, I was taught to “not see” race, though over the years I’ve learned that’s harmful. Tiptoeing around sensitive issues only perpetuates the problem, so I’m trying to put my ego aside and confront these situations head on when they arise. "
Discussed what to do about my parents with my sister to try to find anything I can scratch the surface of.

4. Educate my family members on things they say and do that are racist
5. Do the best I can to remove racism frompeople and situations around me

Reading this article really showed me the difference from being non racist and anti racist. I know many people who claim they are not racist, but they don’t post anything to help the movement, putting them in the neutral zone instead of antirracismos. It is my responsibility to educate these people in order for a more just way of life to prevail in upcoming years. "

"I’ve been working to unlearn a lot over the years. I think it’s mostly my blind spots. The things I don’t know I don’t know. Like abolishing police or prisons. I would have never even thought of that as an option. So it feels less like unlearning and more like learning the things that we’re never taught or brought up as solutions since the problems weren’t talked about. I’m aware of the problems now, or at least more so, but now it’s time to learn about the solutions."
"List 5 ways you will commit to anti-racist work beyond this month:
1. I will continue to read non-fiction books on antiracism & memoirs from Black men and women… but also, I will read fiction as well to read about experiences unlike my own.  
2. I commit to dedicating a portion of my money each year to variety of causes that support antiracism, the BLM movement, black-owned businesses, etc. 
3. I will keep myself informed on the Black Lives Matter movement and share resources, petitions, protests… as well as amplify Black voices. 
4. I commit to speaking out when I hear racist comments - whether that is with friends, family members, colleagues, or strangers. I will speak up against those comments, but also work on my own speech. Rather than get defensive if someone calls out something I say or do, I will thank them for pointing it out and continuously learn to do better.  
5. I will watch documentaries and listen to podcasts dedicated to the topics of antiracism, BLM, code switching, etc. on a regular basis."
"Something I was taught growing up that I'm trying to unlearn: ""Darker skin isn't beautiful"" 
Growing up my mom always told me to stay out of the sun because she didn't want me to ""get black"". I told her I didn't care and it doesn't matter. But as I got older I noticed how lighter skinned people were viewed as more beautiful and I wanted to be lighter (or at least an even skin tone). 
It has taken me a long time to unlearn that your skin color doesn't define your beauty. I'm still working to unlearn this because I think society still values this."
One thing I was taught was that I am actively trying to unlearn is the mindset that I am not racist.  I benefit from a racist system as a white person and being racist and being anti-racist are not mutually exclusive. It’s really hard to unlearn that I’m not the “righteous” or “just” person I believed myself to be. I thought I wasn’t racist or wasn’t this and that but I’m learning that just believing something is wrong doesn’t make a difference if I don’t do anything about that. There’s so much I didn’t know because I didn’t care to know and I am unlearning the fact that that was okay.
I can't just have that conversation. Not right now. But hopefully soon.
"Something I was taught inadvertently growing up is that saying the N-word is acceptable as long as you aren't using it in the traditional sense as a slur. There was zero accountability or repercussions for young white adults in my community that used the word while singing along to a song or as a word to call their friends. This is something that I have had to unlearn and help others unlearn as well. I've learned the history behind that word and why it is absolutely unacceptable to say. 

1.) denounce hate speech whenever I hear it. 
2.) help educate my parents and other family members about harmful racist ideology they have been exposed to. 
3.) help create a safer Greek experience for POC through my actions as a leader in my sorority. 
4.) educate myself by reading and listening to the experiences of POC. 
5.) use my privilege to amplify the voices of POC and help dismantle the system that I benefit from daily. "
"That all the history I have learned is white-washed, designed for my own comfort, and that the disparities and inequities between race are worse now than they ever have been.

Something I was taught: that the civil rights era ended in the 60s.
It’s abundantly clear that civil rights were not fully granted in our society once the CRA was passed. Seeing those pictures of black folks being sprayed by fire hoses and letting police dogs on them was horrifying g and in a sense that explicit visual of racism has ended but there are innumerable ways that our society is still so racist. It’s embarassing thst it took me so long to see what’s happening in ourpresent day when I’ve felt so empowered by reading how horrible things were in the past. And thinking about how far we’ve come. I need to keep remembering everyday that we are not beyond racism or what the civil rights movement was working for. We are still in the same mess, we’ve just done a better job at hiding it and making our systems even more implicitly racist."
I think I’m constantly working to unlearn ideas of meritocracy - that things turn out well for people who work hard at them. I know this to not be the case and I still find it a pervasive assumption in my own life that I have to work against.
"The conversations I had were occassionally difficult because there are generational gaps and sometimes people rely just on the news to learn about racial issues, which aren't always allowing people to see the full truth. I will keep having these conversations and work to build up my knowledge base to make a real change and impact on the people in my life. "
"The concept of anti-racism has its roots in abolition, Ranganathan said — not just the end of slavery but also the call for structural changes in a post-emancipation society, like the eradication of prisons."
"I was taught that we had to respect our elders and what they said shouldn’t be questioned. Including when they said or did racist acts. However, I’m older and can think for myself. Blood and age is not a requirement for respect. I know now to take a stance when hurtful things are said and done."
"I have been talking to my parents and my step-grandma a LOT about racism and privilege, and it’s great because they are all very interested and we are having some great conversations! My family is really liberal though, so it wasn’t a far leap. I grew up hearing political talk at every single family gathering, and all but a couple were on the same liberal page. So I was never around outright racism, thank god. But we are all white, and with that comes privileges and the option to not have to look at how deep this goes. That’s something we didn’t talk much about. What I know is going to be the most difficult is when I come across people who aren’t my family, who are racist. Because they are out there. Boy, are they out there. Some acquaintances, clients...even a couple of friends. With this quarantine, which I am taking very seriously, I kind of get to choose who I want to talk to. So I only want to talk to people who get it!! There will most definitely be difficult conversations to have in my future, they are just thankfully delayed for now. I am delving so deep into what I have ignored for so long, it’s all I can emotionally handle right now. 💙"
Talked to E about how to have conversations about race with our extended family. There are definitely racist comments that are said during family gatherings and I think it is important to start having conversations surrounding that.
Talk to Jim about protests and what they are for. Explain how Ferguson was a turning point for me and how he shares these values. Remind him of Vietnam War protests.

"I have never had a personal bad experience with the police, at least nothing that stands out to me. sometimes i get nervous when i see police around and get worried that I am doing something wrong, but I have not had that many personal interactions with police, and on the rare occasion I did it was frightening but nothing unmanageable. I also do know some family friends who are cops and sometimes my dad tries to use that as a point in the argument about cops, but I have recently seen and learned how corrupt the policing system is and how it has evolved from slave patrol to current day police and has some extremely harmful practices on a systematic level. I have also realized that never having a negative interaction with the police is most certainly a privilege. My personal understanding of what police do and how they interact with certain types of people has certainly changed or been cleared up since my work with anti racism. The level of mistrust between certain cities or communities and the police there is so low and a continuous cycle of fear on one end and targeting on the other occurs. I liked the examples the last video gave that could be concrete ways to defund the police and create a better community for everyone involved. "
"I don’t think I’ve ever been super trustful of the police, but I was always taught to respect them growing up. Since I didn’t really have any encounters with the police, I didn’t think about the policing system as a whole. I did see what was happening on the news, but only attributed the misdoings to bad policies and individual malice by officers. I actually did have a bad experience with police last year, where they harassed and threatened to arrest my friend. He had seen empty police cars and started making jokes about policemen, when an officer literally emerged from the shadows, threatened to arrest him for saying those things, and then went on to talk about how great of a guy he was and how unfair it was for my friend to make that joke. The whole incident was very disturbing and in hindsight I’m disappointed in myself that I didn’t speak up. But it just goes to show that most cops see their jobs as so dangerous and necessary, but won’t hesitate to threaten some innocent person merely making jokes with arrest. My interpretation has been increasingly negative since then, and in the past two months I’ve seen just how flawed the system is and how police have way too much power. "
"In the case of prisons, we as a society need to make a radical change in the way we value life. Our society is focused on treating the effects and OFTEN does not care to fix the causes. We in the US are only focused on making changes after an effect happens. Look at the COVID response. We are literally only focused on the end, not how we get there. We make excuses to maintain the status quo and do not dare make any attempt to rectify the causes. It is so frustrating, but that's how I would approach this conversation. We have to rethink how we value each other and crime. Locking people up isn't the answer."

"Hasan Police Brutality Video- police training; 8 hours on deesclation 127 hours and wepons. Learning how not to hesitste finger gun game. A trainer litterally saying ""you fight violence with better violence, righteous violence"". The reviewing of the police tape is wild! What would happen is the police didn't have a union? Prosecutor's don't charge police because they basically work together. Those Ferguson statistics are insane! How does 70% of an entire community have arrest warrents (mostly for minor issues). Black people are, but ALL people should be against anti-bad cops.

I personally do not feel threatened by the police and I think that is because I am a woman. I don't fear for my life when I'm pulled over, I am worried about paying a huge fine. My bf on the otherhand doesn't have the same feelings. I still don't fear for the cops, but I also don't trust them to save my bf if something were to happen. If I were to call the cops, I would have to make sure he is not around."
"Police started with slave patrols, then KKK, and police turning blind eye to lynchings etc. Black people have no reason to trust police.

"I would explain that what we are doing to incarcerated prisoners is cruel and unusual punishment, and is doing nothing but reinforcing violent behavior. The majority of prisons have little to no programs to better the chances of someone being rehabilitated and not returning. The mass incarceration that began in the era of crack has swelled to astonishing numbers, the majority of which are facing punishments that do not fit the crime. Being imprisoned for things like drug addiction, mental illness, and homelessness is the prison system we’ve created, and it is time to stop this!!! Like they said in the second video from Chicago, it is supposed to be a CORRECTION facility. There is nothing happening to help empower. The idea of restorative justice is a real solution, and actually has the power to better people. Making people face their victims and see them as humans, that is where true empathy, forgiveness and change can begin to happen. And the MOST important tool we can provide to everyone is education, it’s the very least we can do. Come on America, restore my faith in you!"
"I have a strong negative reaction to the police because of where and how I grew up. Throughout my life, other white friends have made fun of me for it because they do not have similar experiences. Main change is a greater commitment to abolition."
My position has changed enough that I’ve stopped trying to negotiate with police departments over the kind of policy they need toward trans people.
"When I was little I thought police officers were great people. My dad, a criminal defense attorney, would introduce me to so many and I felt like they were all so friendly to me. Over time I started to pull away from this belief and especially in the past two months I have changed my opinion. While I do believe those people were nice to me, because they are apart of such a corrupt system and don’t do anything to stop it, they are also apart of the problem no matter how “nice” they appear. I am definitely more scared of police now and think they are bad but also especially scared from my friends and all people of color and especially Black men and women (and non-binary individuals). I see the harm they cause to our society when they are supposed to be those people who help. This needs to change.  "
"I’ve always thought police to generally be the good guys, the killers on the news were just a few bad apples, right? but recently coming to better know the system of policing in its it’s origins, its major racist tendencies and it’s trained trigger finger impulses, I’ve come to despise policing. They need to be abolished if not defunded and overhauled."

I did assume before that Black families were unstable and that was the ‘cause’ now I know that 1- single parent families are not the problem 2-we white people are the cause of challenges faced by black youth
"I think that I never thought about the damage it does to Black families to be split up by the foster care system. Since I was a guardian ad litem in law school, my experience was largely termination of parental rights, and I don’t remember parents even showing up that often, so I think I must’ve assumed that meant the child would be better off away from the parents. But I didn’t have the maturity to understand the precarity of Black lives and what factors may have prevented the parents’ appearance, whether taking the bus that was late or not being able to get off work without getting fired. But I am learning now."
That was awesome. More of that. Creates empathy and the desire to help.
I think I learned a lot more from tv than I would think...but watching shows like family matters and prince of bellaire only showed one side of the story. I wish I knew more growing up
The most common misconception I think I have about black families is that the parents aren't together anymore. I learned this as a child growing up with friends who had single mothers and fathers. I assumed many black parents were divorced or not together. I knew thiz because when I found a black family together i was surprised.

"I discussed the role of race in my upbringing with my mom and it was definitely a difficult conversation to have. We have talked about the current movement a lot and how my family dynamic has shifted over the years in terms of understanding and paying more attention to these issues. Growing up I always went to public school in a diverse area and was never sheltered from any type of person or any situation. I loved going to public school because I thought it was such a real world experience. But I talked to my mom about how even though I was not put in a situation with only people like me, I typically ended up with friends that were similar to me in terms of race, religion, SES, etc and why that might be. I would love to continue having this conversation with my mom and definitely talk about it more with my dad, who tends to be less open about having these conversations and seems more set on his beliefs.

"I had a conversation today with my mom about racism in my high school. Today my community hosted a discussion about this topic where many of my friends and classmates spoke about their experiences with discrimination at my school. I told my mom all about it and something we have a hard time talking about is like whether or not something actually happens because of discrimination or if it’s outside factors. To me I think it is easy to see how students are discriminated against because of their race through not only words but also restriction from honors, AP, and gifted program classes. To my mom, she wants the direct correlation but that isn’t always possible to have those statistics right now. By listening to my peers I know these instances of restriction are acts of discrimination because for me and many of my white peers, we never had a problem with this. I think my mom and I agree on the general principles of things but sometimes even these little disagreements make it hard to make it through the conversation. "
"- great advice to start by explaining your learning journey, and remind the person that you also used to think like them, and not understand the importance of these issues. “I know that you care about people, so I know that you can learn new things and change your thinking too” - helps address defensiveness"
"I think this was a really important and informative thing to listen to for myself. As a young white girl i’ve had conversations with my family multiple times, especially over the last month or so, along with some others. However sometimes they have been somewhat confrontational due to my frustration and the feeling of hitting a brick wall. Now I recognise that if I think more about the structure or what I’m trying to get across, and train a little more patience then perhaps I will have more success with getting them to understand the need for urgent action for multiple issues concerning both race and other issues."
"Because I am white, I never really had conversations with my parents about race growing up. Now, however, I recognize the importance of beginning anti-racism conversations as early as possible to avoid bringing up new generations within the same racist systems I grew up in. "
"I spoke with my dad. It was hard. He plays it off as an unfixable problem, thus he doesn't want to discuss. He also referenced the use of affirmative action in the Navy, so he was unwilling to discuss that too. It got more confrontational than I hoped, but there was listening. "
"I’m not sure I can have this conversation with my parents.  I think they’re a lost cause.  They’re so caught up in their own idea of righteousness and so convinced of their innate goodness that they can’t open their eyes to see the corrupt system they’ve lived in their whole lives.  
How do I navigate a relationship with them wher they are always right and any confrontation ends in them shouting far-right conspiracy theories at me?"
My friend and I mostly agreed about how our school addressed race and what actions they need to take in order to improve the way they educate. It was comforting to hear that others felt similar to me in that we severely lacked education on racism.
"Author is a black women with a white mother. Speaking to the conversations she’s had with her white parent.

Confrontational conversations aren’t helpful and aren’t going to serve your purpose.

Sometimes you just need people to stop saying or doing harmful things so there’s another way to approach that conversation.

While people need to sit down and talk to other white people about the power we have and what we can do to create strategic plans so black people are treated equitably. We need real actions community plans and family plans. 

When having conversations it’s important to state why you’re having the conversation. What’s the goal? Remember this is why we’re having the conversation. 

Every generation is shaped by the environment you grow up in. Sometimes there’s a generational divide and that’s why it’s important to state the goal. 

Ask black friends what they need at this time? 

I really like the idea of having a goal for the conversation.

"“Anti-racism is understanding how years of federal, state, and local policies have placed communities of color in the crises they face today, and calling those policies out for what they are: racist.

It also requires an understanding of one’s own position in a racist society, many say, an acknowledgment that you can’t simply opt out of living in white supremacy by saying you’re “not a racist” — you have to actively fight against it. “

This is a big one. "
Trying to have these conversations with family and friends daily.. working on being a better listener instead of reacting to a disagreement.
"It was very difficult with my grandpa first because of language barriers and because he’s an immigrant. As an immigrant myself, I completely understand how the “I think the US is better than when I lived in _______” responde, and my grandpa, from what I understood, has also been through his own trauma. I don’t think I changed his mind much, but I got him to be more supportive about MY protests for BLM. I don’t know if this is just because he loves me and is family, or if he actually supports the movement...."
"My conversation with my dad went pretty well. I think I was able to get him to understand that there ARE more challenges for black people than white people, but I think the nuance is a bit lost on him. In addition, he tends to focus on specific fringe cases as his examples for how society functions which distracts from the conversation, but I hope we continue to talk about race. "
I'm very happy with this platform. I love the small pieces of work plus reflection.
"I’ve had small conversations with family members, and most of the time it is awkward. The points I’m trying to get across though, are more powerful than the awkwardness and that’s what has allowed me to continue having these conversations. Everyone needs to start talking about the racism in this country, and allow it to be a stepping stone to a brighter and just future in this nation. "
Just thinking about having this conversation is difficult. I did have a difficult conversation with a coworker today though.

The conversion was really awkward. My family has the same opinions but they don’t voice them. My extended family (grandparents) are all conservatives and have totally different opinions so it’s rough talking to them. I used to not have a voice in my opinions because that’s how I was taught but social media has helped me with that! I would work things differently if I could redo my conversations but.....
"I keep having conversations with my dad, and will keep having them. It’s hard for him to be so willfully ignorant in order to protect his own comfort."
"-Start from a place of what you used to think & where you are at now with the topic of race
-Know what you want out of the conversation (Do you want them to hear you or be more supportive of your efforts or to act or to stop doing something they are doing... know your goal)
-Don’t start out rudely confrontational... they will stand in defensiveness
-Talk about real action & figure out what they can do where they are at ((it’s not about starting fights, it’s about getting people to understand and bring justice for the Black community... not to push people further away from this by starting fights instead of well-intentioned conversations))
-Know when to step away from the conversation that is not achieving your goal & come back to it when emotions have settled"

I think the conversation with my parents was good. We’ve been talking a lot about this recently and I think it’s hard for them sometimes to wrap their head around everything because theyve grown up with a completely different mentality but that helps me grow and learn to talk about it better and not just be complacent or get comfortable feeling a certain way. It helped me think more about what I was saying how I was saying it and why I was saying it.
This has been helpful!
These conversations are hard due to such deep seeded ideas of racism within my parents generation. Defensiveness is a natural first reaction when someone is told that their ideals they were raised on may not be socially just.
"I actually had a conversation with my mom the other day about it. we definitely agree on pretty much everything except the cops. i believe in acab, and she does not. i understand her reasoning, but the system is corrupt. she still agree on defunding them though, so that’s good. "

"Have more conversations with my neighbours on walks! 
Ensure our green spaces are welcoming and bright 
Begin to collect waste on our walks 
Since C-19 our neighbours have been far more inviting and we’ve met so many lovely people who have made a really great impact "

I hear the clicking of a keyboard, makes me feel stressed and annoyed. "

"I hear my brothers music playing quietly in the background, I hear keyboards and chairs creaking, and I hear my parents having a conversation. I feel relaxed because everyone is doing their own thing. "
"I’m actually listening to some soft pop music, so that’s the only sound immediately perceptible. It’s quite quiet at 1 in the morning, but the tap, tap, tap of my nails on my phone keyboard reminds me there’s still a significant portion of my social life to be checked on various media sites. I’m getting tired starting at the white screens, so perhaps it’s time for bed. "
"I think he probably knows about the first and third ones! So he'll ask me the second question. 

So I should have expected this and he says he wants to go home and be with his family back in Hyderabad. A few months later probably, Goa or Andaman just because Iove Beaches. "

"World with out prison: Healing Hut? When a crime is committed. A breach of trust in a relationship has happened. Resorative Justice.
Watch for more video: we've all hurt and been hurt. We need more real accountability, not punishment.
I am still working on the concept of resotatice justice in place of prison, however, I like the idea, I just don't know if I trust people not to repeat offend. I think that has to do with my outlook on life and people as selfish beings as a whole. 
The extra video really helped me understand what it means to have restorative justice in place of a prison.  
I could not read the article because I do not have a NYT subscription. "

"Building restorative justice centres, employment centres, safe housing.

Investing in alternative models 

What would it look like to build better communities for everyone."
She’s incredible.
"1. Push back when media interviews are offered to me first
2. Share speaking gigs"
"I do have a couple of people in my life that have a history of telling racist jokes or said racist ideas without even realizing that they were racist ideas. I’m going to speak up. I always worry because I tend to get emotional, and then people don’t always hear me. So that is going to be a big challenge for me, learning how to stand up and articulate without getting too worked up. It goes against every fiber of my being, I am a passionate gal! If I ever get to leave the house again, I vow to be more aware of my surroundings and interactions. Looking at things through a anti-racist lens as opposed to the White blinders. "
I can be conscious of how much space I take up. I can repeat and echo things Black women say. I can check other white people saying harmful things.
Pretty good. Ended abruptly. Looked daunting bc it was long. But I ended up watching it all. I think we should say “10 min is better than nothing” then folks might end up watching it all like me.
"I think that I can support my black colleagues by letting my voice be heard as a brown person as well. I usually don't speak up because I don't feel my opinion matters as much, but in order for my voice to be heard I need to talk. I need to support my black colleagues as well!"
"Not sure if this would've fit the lesson structure or if it's against the point of the lessons, but it might have been nice to revisit previous days' self-awareness activities at some point. Like trying to meditate again and comparing it to the first time, or noticing changes in your day to day journal entries. "
"I enjoyed the 6 day course , but wish it would be longer. I need to work on my mindfulness more. Thank you"
"Regrowing green onions, mostly scraps for plant fertilizer though. "

"I love tie dye and we always get beets and other wonderful veggies with natural dyes in them so I would love to try dyeing some clothes with our scraps!! 
We have also regrown some veggies from past weeks and seasons and planted them in the garden - while not perfect we have been trying our best to use what we can "

"1) call out family members who make racially inappropriate comments
2) provide family or friends with examples or resources of how to better understand 
3) discuss ways to better support our black students at school
4) continue educating myself and humbly remember that I am not an expert 
5) know that no matter what work I do, I still will never understand so if I am called out for something - listen and learn "
"Excellent

Yikes. Estos hechos me duelen el corazón. Ahora he enseñado algunos de los hechos a mis seguidores en insta.
I loved this!

This was a great program! This helped me stay on track to set aside a little bit of time each day to acknowledge the problem of racism in our country. I was able to look inside myself and reflect on my own privilege and how I can use that to help make a difference.
I feel like this is very informative and provides lots of resources for learning more about how to become antiracist

"No, what I was taught in high school is if you work hard you can achieve anything. Myth of meritocracy. I was not taught that race is a social construct and that systems can be racist and oppressive. "
I would love to continue doing this and learning about what I can do to change this country to better ways.
Making anti-racism a daily practice feels like an important commitment now.
This whole experience has been awesome! It’s so helpful to see and share people thought especially yours!
Week 2 here I come!!!
I really liked this and I think more people should know about it because I think it’s good for people at all levels of familiarity with anti-racism work and still teaches a lot and gets people to reflect a lot.

I would like to be able to access multiple days of material at once for days that I am too busy to do just one at a time

Today my aunt came over! I was looking forward to having a relaxing day just hanging out with my family and eating yummy food!
"Uhhh... not much
- I can make people laugh from my discomfort
- I can say good morning as I pass people on the street
- I can encourage good behaviors"
Today I started work and thought about this all day. How can I add value. I think the one thing that came to mind consistently was to bring laughter. It’s a stressful time for some of us making changes to our teaching platforms. Everything is virtual so why not keep everyone laughing. I think it helped ❤️
"I can add value by complementing my team, collaborating with them, and just listening to them in general. "
"1) send a thank-you card to a mentor 
2) enforce mask wearing and social distancing guidelines 
3) reach out to new UNC students/ask to grab a socially-distanced coffee with them the first week of classes 

Many people have added value to my life, but my family comes to mind first. Especially since I’m leaving them in a few days, I am particularly thankful for their love and support."
"If you were to accomplish a major goal in the next 3 months, what would you do to celebrate? "

I've gotten way way better at multitasking while meal prepping. I can make multiple meals in 2-3 hours now and I think this will definitely be useful when you've gotta deal with life

I would like to be less stressed about the things that are beyond my control
"We already compost here and have green bin collection! We’re lucky to have this for sure and make use of it literally everyday - we have a green bin for food scraps, bathroom waste (compostable products) and evening for our cat litter which is all natural and compostable! "
